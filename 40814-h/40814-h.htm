<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="l5" />

<p class="center f9">TO THE READER.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I present</span> you with my first continuous story.
I do not dignify it by the name of &ldquo;A novel.&rdquo;
I am aware that it is entirely at variance with
all set rules for novel-writing. There is no intricate
plot; there are no startling developments,
no hair-breadth escapes. I have compressed
into one volume what I might have expanded into
two or three. I have avoided long introductions
and descriptions, and have entered unceremoniously
and unannounced, into people&rsquo;s houses,
without stopping to ring the bell. Whether you
will fancy this primitive mode of calling, whether
you will like the company to which it introduces
you, or&mdash;whether you will like the book at all, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
cannot tell. Still, I cherish the hope that, somewhere
in the length and breadth of the land, it
may fan into a flame, in some tried heart, the
fading embers of hope, well-nigh extinguished by
wintry fortune and summer friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> old church clock rang solemnly out on the midnight
air. Ruth started. For hours she had sat there,
leaning her cheek upon her hand, and gazing through the
open space between the rows of brick walls, upon the
sparkling waters of the bay, glancing and quivering &rsquo;neath
the moon-beams. The city&rsquo;s busy hum had long since
died away; myriad restless eyes had closed in peaceful
slumber; Ruth could not sleep. This was the last
time she would sit at that little window. The morrow
would find her in a home of her own. On the morrow
Ruth would be a bride.</p>

<p>Ruth was not sighing because she was about to leave
her father&rsquo;s roof, (for her childhood had been anything
but happy,) but she was vainly trying to look into a
future, which God has mercifully veiled from curious
eyes. Had that craving heart of hers at length found its
ark of refuge? Would clouds or sunshine, joy or sorrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
tears or smiles, predominate in her future? Who could
tell? The silent stars returned her no answer. Would
a harsh word ever fall from lips which now breathed only
love? Would the step whose lightest footfall now made
her heart leap, ever sound in her ear like a death-knell?
As time, with its ceaseless changes, rolled on, would love
flee affrighted from the bent form, and silver locks, and
faltering footstep? Was there no talisman to keep
him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange questions,&rdquo; were they, &ldquo;for a young girl!&rdquo;
Ah, but Ruth could remember when she was no taller
than a rosebush, how cravingly her little heart cried
out for love! How a careless word, powerless to wound
one less sensitive, would send her, weeping, to that
little room for hours; and, young as she was, life&rsquo;s
pains seemed already more to her than life&rsquo;s pleasures.
Would it <em>always</em> be so? Would she find more thorns
than roses in her <em>future</em> pathway?</p>

<p>Then, Ruth remembered how she used to wish she
were beautiful,&mdash;not that she might be admired, but that
she might be loved. But Ruth was &ldquo;very plain,&rdquo;&mdash;so
her brother Hyacinth told her, and &ldquo;awkward,&rdquo; too;
she had heard that ever since she could remember; and
the recollection of it dyed her cheek with blushes, whenever
a stranger made his appearance in the home circle.</p>

<p>So, Ruth was fonder of being alone by herself; and
then, they called her &ldquo;odd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; and wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
if she would &ldquo;ever make anything;&rdquo; and Ruth used to
wonder, too; and sometimes she asked herself why
a sweet strain of music, or a fine passage in a poem,
made her heart thrill, and her whole frame quiver with
emotion?</p>

<p>The world smiled on her brother Hyacinth. He was
handsome, and gifted. He could win fame, and what
was better, love. Ruth wished he would love her a little.
She often used to steal into his room and &ldquo;right&rdquo; his papers,
when the stupid housemaid had displaced them; and
often she would prepare him a tempting little lunch, and
carry it to his room, on his return from his morning
walk; but Hyacinth would only say, &ldquo;Oh, it is you,
Ruth, is it? I thought it was Bridget;&rdquo; and go on reading
his newspaper.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s mother was dead. Ruth did not remember a
great deal about her&mdash;only that she always looked uneasy
about the time her father was expected home; and
when his step was heard in the hall, she would say in a
whisper, to Hyacinth and herself, &ldquo;Hush! hush! your
father is coming;&rdquo; and then Hyacinth would immediately
stop whistling, or humming, and Ruth would run up into
her little room, for fear she should, in some unexpected
way, get into disgrace.</p>

<p>Ruth, also, remembered when her father came home
and found company to tea, how he frowned and complained
of headache, although he always ate as heartily as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
any of the company; and how after tea he would stretch
himself out upon the sofa and say, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a
nap;&rdquo; and then, he would close his eyes, and if the company
commenced talking, he would start up and say to
Ruth, who was sitting very still in the corner, &ldquo;<em>Ruth</em>, don&rsquo;t
make such a noise;&rdquo; and when Ruth&rsquo;s mother would
whisper gently in his ear, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, dear,
if you laid down up stairs? it is quite comfortable and
quiet there,&rdquo; her father would say, aloud, &ldquo;Oh yes, oh
yes, you want to get rid of me, do you?&rdquo; And then her
mother would say, turning to the company, &ldquo;How very
fond Mr. Ellet is of a joke!&rdquo; But Ruth remembered
that her mother often blushed when she said so, and that
her laugh did not sound natural.</p>

<p>After her mother&rsquo;s death, Ruth was sent to boarding-school,
where she shared a room with four strange girls,
who laid awake all night, telling the most extraordinary
stories, and ridiculing Ruth for being such an old maid
that she could not see &ldquo;where the laugh came in.&rdquo; Equally
astonishing to the unsophisticated Ruth, was the demureness
with which they would bend over their books
when the pale, meek-eyed widow, employed as duenna,
went the rounds after tea, to see if each inmate was preparing
the next day&rsquo;s lessons, and the coolness with which
they would jump up, on her departure, put on their
bonnets and shawls, and slip out at the side-street door
to meet expectant lovers; and when the pale widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
went the rounds again at nine o&rsquo;clock, she would find
them demurely seated, just where she left them, apparently
busily conning their lessons! Ruth wondered if <em>all</em>
girls were as mischievous, and if fathers and mothers
ever stopped to think what companions their daughters
would have for room-mates and bed-fellows, when they
sent them away from home. As to the Principal, Madame
Moreau, she contented herself with sweeping her
flounces, once a day, through the recitation rooms; so it
was not a difficult matter, in so large an establishment, to
pass muster with the sub-teachers at recitations.</p>

<p>Composition day was the general bugbear. Ruth&rsquo;s
madcap room-mates were struck with the most unqualified
amazement and admiration at the facility with which
&ldquo;the old maid&rdquo; executed this frightful task. They soon
learned to put her services in requisition; first, to help
them out of this slough of despond; next, to save them
the necessity of wading in at all, by writing their compositions
for them.</p>

<p>In the all-absorbing love affairs which were constantly
going on between the young ladies of Madame Moreau&rsquo;s
school and their respective admirers, Ruth took no interest;
and on the occasion of the unexpected reception of a
bouquet, from a smitten swain, accompanied by a copy of
amatory verses, Ruth crimsoned to her temples and burst
into tears, that any one could be found so heartless as to
burlesque the &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; Ruth. Simple child! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was unconscious that, in the freedom of that atmosphere
where a &ldquo;prophet out of his own country is honored,&rdquo;
her lithe form had rounded into symmetry and grace,
her slow step had become light and elastic, her eye
bright, her smile winning, and her voice soft and melodious.
Other bouquets, other notes, and glances of involuntary
admiration from passers-by, at length opened her
eyes to the fact, that she was &ldquo;plain, awkward Ruth&rdquo; no
longer. Eureka! She had arrived at the first epoch in
a young girl&rsquo;s life,&mdash;she had found out her power! Her
manners became assured and self-possessed. <em>She</em>, Ruth,
could inspire love! Life became dear to her. There
was something worth living for&mdash;something to look forward
to. She had a motive&mdash;an aim; she should <em>some</em>
day make somebody&rsquo;s heart glad,&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s hearth-stone
bright; somebody should be proud of her; and oh,
how she <em>could</em> love that somebody! History, astronomy,
mathematics, the languages, were all pastime now. Life
wore a new aspect; the skies were bluer, the earth greener,
the flowers more fragrant;&mdash;her twin-soul existed
somewhere.</p>

<p>When Ruth had been a year at school, her elegant
brother Hyacinth came to see her. Ruth dashed
down her books, and bounded down three stairs at a
time, to meet him; for she loved him, poor child, just
as well as if he were worth loving. Hyacinth drew
languidly back a dozen paces, and holding up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hands, drawled out imploringly, &ldquo;kiss me if you
insist on it, Ruth, but for heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tumble
my dickey.&rdquo; He also remarked, that her shoes were
too large for her feet, and that her little French apron
was &ldquo;slightly askew;&rdquo; and told her, whatever else she
omitted, to be sure to learn &ldquo;to waltz.&rdquo; He was then
introduced to Madame Moreau, who remarked to Madame
Chicchi, her Italian teacher, what a very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</i>
looking person he was; after which he yawned several
times, then touched his hat gracefully, praised &ldquo;the
very superior air of the establishment,&rdquo; brushed an imperceptible
atom of dust from his beaver, kissed the
tips of his fingers to his demonstrative sister, and tiptoed
Terpsichoreally over the academic threshold.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Ruth&rsquo;s father wrote occasionally
when a term-bill became due, or when his tradesmen&rsquo;s
bills came in, on the first of January; on which occasion
an annual fit of poverty seized him, an almshouse
loomed up in perspective, he reduced the wages
of his cook two shillings, and advised Ruth either to
get married or teach school.</p>

<p>Three years had passed under Madame Moreau&rsquo;s roof;
Ruth&rsquo;s schoolmates wondering the while why she took
so much pains to bother her head with those stupid
books, when she was every day growing prettier, and
all the world knew that it was quite unnecessary for a
pretty woman to be clever. When Ruth once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
crossed the paternal threshold, Hyacinth levelled his
eye-glass at her, and exclaimed, &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon honor, Ruth,
you&rsquo;ve positively had a narrow escape from being handsome.&rdquo;
Whether old Mr. Ellet was satisfied with her
physical and mental progress, Ruth had no means of
knowing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now, as we have said before, it is the night before
Ruth&rsquo;s bridal; and there she sits, though the old
church bell has long since chimed the midnight hour,
gazing at the moon, as she cuts a shining path through
the waters; and trembling, while she questions the dim,
uncertain future. Tears, Ruth? Have phantom shapes
of terror glided before those gentle prophet eyes? Has
death&rsquo;s dark wing even now fanned those girlish temples?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was so odd in Ruth to have no one but the family
at the wedding. It was just one of her queer freaks!
Where was the use of her white satin dress and orange
wreath? what the use of her looking handsomer than
she ever did before, when there was nobody there to
see her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody to see her?&rdquo; Mark that manly form at
her side; see his dark eye glisten, and his chiselled lip
quiver, as he bends an earnest gaze on her who realizes
all his boyhood dreams. Mistaken ones! it is not admiration
which that young beating heart craves; it is
love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very fine-looking, presentable fellow,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
as the carriage rolled away with his new brother-in-law.
&ldquo;Really, love is a great beautifier. Ruth looked
quite handsome to-night. Lord bless me! how immensely
tiresome it must be to sit opposite the same
face three times a day, three hundred and sixty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
days in a year! I should weary of Venus herself. I&rsquo;m
glad my handsome brother-in-law is in such good circumstances.
Duns <em>are</em> a bore. I must keep on the
right side of him. Tom, was that tailor here again
yesterday? Did you tell him I was out of town?
Right, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, I <em>hope</em> Harry will be happy,&rdquo; said Ruth&rsquo;s
mother-in-law, old Mrs. Hall, as she untied
her cap-strings, and seated herself in the newly-furnished
parlor, to await the coming of the bride and bridegroom.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, though, that I see the need of his
being married. I always mended his socks. He has
sixteen bran new shirts, eight linen and eight cotton.
I made them myself out of the Hamilton long-cloth.
Hamilton long-cloth is good cotton, too; strong, firm,
and wears well. Eight cotton and eight linen shirts!
Can anybody tell what he got married for? <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t
know. If he tired of his boarding-house, of course he
could always come home. As to Ruth, I don&rsquo;t know
anything about her. Of course she is perfect in <em>his</em>
eyes. I remember the time when he used to think <em>me</em>
perfect. I suppose I shall be laid on the shelf now.
Well, what beauty he can find in that pale, golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hair, and those blue-gray eyes, I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t
say I fancy the family either. Proud as Lucifer, all
of &rsquo;em. Nothing to be proud of, either. The father
next to nothing when he began life. The son, a conceited
jackanapes, who divides his time between writing
rhymes and inventing new ties for his cravat. Well,
well, we shall see; but I doubt if this bride is anything
but a well-dressed doll. I&rsquo;ve been peeping into her
bureau drawers to-day. What is the use of all those
ruffles on her under-clothes, I&rsquo;d like to know? Who&rsquo;s
going to wash and iron them? <em>Presents</em> to her! Well,
why don&rsquo;t people make <em>sensible</em> presents,&mdash;a dozen of
dish towels, some crash rollers, a ball of wick-yarn, or
the like of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-o-oh <strong title="dear">d-e-a-r</strong>! there&rsquo;s the carriage! Now, for one
month to come, to say the least, I shall be made perfectly
sick with their billing and cooing. I shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if Harry didn&rsquo;t speak to me oftener than
once a day. Had he married a practical woman I
wouldn&rsquo;t have cared&mdash;somebody who looked as if God
made her for something; but that little yellow-haired
simpleton&mdash;umph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Ruth, in happy ignorance of the state of her
new mother-in-law&rsquo;s feelings, moved about her apartments
in a sort of blissful dream. How odd it seemed,
this new freedom, this being one&rsquo;s own mistress. How
odd to see that shaving-brush and those razors lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<em>her</em> toilet table! then that saucy looking smoking-cap,
those slippers and that dressing-gown, those fancy neck-ties,
too, and vests and coats, in unrebuked proximity
to her muslins, laces, silks and de laines!</p>

<p>Ruth liked it.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Good</span> morning, Ruth; <em>Mrs. Hall</em> I suppose I <em>should</em>
call you, only that I can&rsquo;t get used to being
shoved one side quite so suddenly,&rdquo; said the old lady,
with a faint attempt at a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t say Mrs. Hall to <em>me</em>&rdquo; said Ruth,
handing her a chair; &ldquo;call me any name that best
pleases you; I shall be quite satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you feel quite lonesome when Harry is
away, attending to business, and as if you hardly knew
what to do with yourself; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ruth, with a glad smile, &ldquo;not at all,
I was just thinking whether I was not glad to have
him gone a little while, so that I could sit down and
think how much I love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady moved uneasily in her chair. &ldquo;I suppose
you understand all about housekeeping, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth blushed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have but just
returned from boarding-school. I asked Harry to wait
till I had learned house-keeping matters, but he was
not willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady untied her cap-strings, and patted the
floor restlessly with her foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a great pity you were not brought up properly,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I learned all that a girl should learn,
before I married. Harry has his fortune yet to make,
you know. Young people, now-a-days, seem to think
that money comes in showers, whenever it is wanted;
that&rsquo;s a mistake; a penny at a time&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way
we got ours; that&rsquo;s the way Harry and you will have
to get yours. Harry has been brought up sensibly.
He has been taught economy; he is, like me, naturally
of a very generous turn; he will occasionally offer you
pin-money. In those cases, it will be best for you to
pass it over to me to keep; of course you can always
have it again, by telling me how you wish to spend it.
I would advise you, too, to lay by all your handsome
clothes. As to the silk stockings you were married in,
of course you will never be so extravagant as to wear
them again. I never had a pair of silk stockings in my
life; they have a very silly, frivolous look. Do you
know how to iron, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;I have sometimes clear-starched
my own muslins and laces.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it; did you ever seat a pair of pantaloons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruth, repressing a laugh, and yet half inclined
to cry; &ldquo;you forget that I am just home from
boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make bread? When I say <em>bread</em> I <em>mean</em>
bread&mdash;old fashioned, yeast riz bread; none of your sal-soda,
salæratus, sal-volatile poisonous mixtures, that must
be eaten as quick as baked, lest it should dry up; <em>yeast</em>
bread&mdash;do you know how to make it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruth, with a growing sense of her utter
good-for-nothingness; &ldquo;people in the city always buy
baker&rsquo;s bread; my father did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father! land&rsquo;s sake, child, you mustn&rsquo;t quote
your father now you&rsquo;re married; you haven&rsquo;t any
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never had, thought Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure; what does the Bible say? &lsquo;Forsaking
father and mother, cleave to your wife,&rsquo; (or husband,
which amounts to the same thing, I take it;) and speaking
of that, I hope you won&rsquo;t be always running home,
or running anywhere in fact. Wives should be keepers at
home. Ruth,&rdquo; continued the old lady after a short
pause, &ldquo;do you know I should like your looks better, if
you didn&rsquo;t curl your hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t curl it,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;it curls naturally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
avoid everything that looks frivolous; you must try
and pomatum it down. And Ruth, if you should feel
the need of exercise, don&rsquo;t gad in the streets. Remember
there is nothing like a broom and a dust-pan
to make the blood circulate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You keep a rag bag, I suppose,&rdquo; said the old lady;
&ldquo;many&rsquo;s the glass dish I&rsquo;ve peddled away my scissors-clippings
for. &lsquo;Waste not, want not.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got that
framed somewhere. I&rsquo;ll hunt it up, and put it on your
wall. It won&rsquo;t do you any harm to read it now and
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; continued the old lady, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t
read novels and such trash. I have a very select little
library, when you feel inclined to read, consisting of a
treatise on &lsquo;The Complaints of Women,&rsquo; an excellent sermon
on Predestination, by our old minister, Dr. Diggs,
and Seven Reasons why John Rogers, the martyr, must
have had <em>ten</em> children instead of <em>nine</em> (as is <em>generally</em>
supposed); any time that you stand in need of <em>rational</em>
reading come to me;&rdquo; and the old lady, smoothing a
wrinkle in her black silk apron, took a dignified leave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Poor Ruth!</span> her sky so soon overcast! As the
door closed on the prim, retreating figure of her
mother-in-law, she burst into tears. But she was too
sensible a girl to weep long. She wiped her eyes,
and began to consider what was to be done. It would
never do to complain to Harry&mdash;dear Harry. He
would have to take sides; oh no, that would never
do; she could never complain to him of his <em>own</em>
mother. But why did he bring them together? knowing,
as he must have known, how little likely they
were to assimilate. This thought she smothered quickly,
but not before it had given birth to a sigh, close upon
the heels of which love framed this apology: It was
so long since Harry had lived under the same roof
with his mother he had probably forgotten her eccentricities;
and then she was so dotingly fond of him,
that probably no points of collision ever came up between
the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of an hour, what with cold bathing and
philosophy, Ruth&rsquo;s eyes and equanimity were placed beyond
the suspicion even of a newly-made husband, and
when she held up her lips to him so temptingly, on his
return, he little dreamed of the self-conquest she had so
tearfully achieved for his sake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Harry&rsquo;s</span> father began life on a farm in Vermont.
Between handling ploughs, hoes, and harrows, he
had managed to pick up sufficient knowledge to establish
himself as a country doctor; well contented to
ride six miles on horseback of a stormy night, to extract
a tooth for some distracted wretch, for twenty-five
cents. Naturally loquacious, and equally fond of administering
jalap and gossip, he soon became a great
favorite with the &ldquo;women folks,&rdquo; which every aspiring
Esculapius, who reads this, knows to be half the battle.
They soon began to trust him, not only in drawing
teeth, but in cases involving the increase of the village
census. Several successes in this line, which he
took no pains to conceal, put him behind a gig of his
own, and enabled his practice to overtake his fame as
far as the next village.</p>

<p>Like many other persons, who revolve all their life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in a peck measure, the doctor&rsquo;s views of the world
in general, and its denizens in particular, were somewhat
circumscribed. Added to this, he was as persevering
as a fly in the dog-days, and as immovable as the
old rusty weather-cock on the village meeting-house,
which for twenty years had never been blown about
by any whisking wind of doctrine. &ldquo;When he opened
his mouth, no dog must bark;&rdquo; and any dissent from
his opinion, however circumspectly worded, he considered
a personal insult. As his wife entertained the
same liberal views, occasional conjugal collisions, on
this narrow track, were the consequence; the interest
of which was intensified by each reminding the
other of their Calvinistic church obligations to keep
the peace. They had, however, one common ground
of undisputed territory&mdash;their &ldquo;<em>Son Harry</em>,&rdquo; who was
as infallible as the Pope, and (until he got married)
never did a foolish thing since he was born. On this
last point, their &ldquo;Son Harry&rdquo; did not exactly agree
with them, as he considered it decidedly the most delightful
negotiation he had ever made, and one which
he could not even think of without a sudden acceleration
of pulse.</p>

<p>Time wore on, the young couple occupying their
own suite of apartments, while the old people kept
house. The doctor, who had saved enough to lay his
saddle-bags with his medical books on the shelf, busied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
himself, after he had been to market in the morning,
in speculating on what Ruth was about, or in peeping
over the balustrade, to see who called when the bell
rang; or, in counting the wood-pile, to see how many
sticks the cook had taken to make the pot boil for dinner.
The second girl (a supernumerary of the bridal
week) had long since been dismissed; and the doctor
and his wife spent their evenings with the cook, to save
the expense of burning an extra lamp. Consequently,
Betty soon began to consider herself one of the family,
and surprised Ruth one day by modestly requesting
the loan of her bridal veil &ldquo;to wear to a little party;&rdquo;
not to speak of sundry naps to which she treated herself
in Ruth&rsquo;s absence, in her damask rocking chair,
which was redolent, for some time after, of a strong odor
of dish-water.</p>

<p>Still, Ruth kept her wise little mouth shut; moving,
amid these discordant elements, as if she were deaf,
dumb, and blind.</p>

<p>Oh, love! that thy silken reins could so curb the
spirit and bridle the tongue, that thy uplifted finger of
warning could calm that bounding pulse, still that throbbing
heart, and send those rebellious tears, unnoticed,
back to their source.</p>

<p>Ah! could we lay bare the secret history of many a
wife&rsquo;s heart, what martyrs would be found, over whose uncomplaining
lips the grave sets its unbroken seal of silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>But was Harry blind and deaf? Had the bridegroom
of a few months grown careless and unobservant?
Was he, to whom every hair of that sunny head was
dear, blind to the inward struggles, marked only by fits
of feverish gaiety? Did he never see the sudden <em>ruse</em>
to hide the tell-tale blush, or starting tear? Did it
escape his notice, that Ruth would start, like a guilty
thing, if a sudden impulse of tenderness betrayed her
into laying her hand upon his forehead, or leaning
her head upon his shoulder, or throwing her arms
about his neck, when the jealous mother was by? Did
not his soul bend the silent knee of homage to that
youthful self-control that could repress its own warm
emotions, and stifle its own sorrows, lest <em>he</em> should know
a heart-pang?</p>

<p>Yes; Ruth read it in the magnetic glance of the loving
eye as it lingeringly rested on her, and in the low,
thrilling tone of the whispered, &ldquo;God bless you, my
wife;&rdquo; and many an hour, when alone in his counting
room, was Harry, forgetful of business, revolving plans
for a separate home for himself and Ruth.</p>

<p>This was rendered every day more necessary, by the
increased encroachments of the old people, who insisted
that no visitors should remain in the house after the old-fashioned
hour of nine; at which time the fire should
be taken apart, the chairs set up, the lights extinguished,
and a solemn silence brood until the next morning&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cock-crowing. It was also suggested to the young
couple, that the wear and tear of the front entry carpet
might be saved by their entering the house by the back
gate, instead of the front door.</p>

<p>Meals were very solemn occasions; the old people
frowning, at such times, on all attempts at conversation,
save when the doctor narrated the market prices he paid
for each article of food upon the table. And so time
wore on. The old couple, like two scathed trees, dry,
harsh, and uninviting, presenting only rough surfaces to
the clinging ivy, which fain would clothe with brightest
verdure their leafless branches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Hark!</span> to that tiny wail! Ruth knows that most
blessed of all hours. Ruth is a <em>mother</em>! Joy to
thee, Ruth! Another outlet for thy womanly heart; a
mirror, in which thy smiles and tears shall be reflected
back; a fair page, on which thou, God-commissioned,
mayst write what thou wilt; a heart that will throb
back to thine, love for love.</p>

<p>But Ruth thinks not of all this now, as she lies pale
and motionless upon the pillow, while Harry&rsquo;s grateful
tears bedew his first-born&rsquo;s face. She cannot even welcome
the little stranger. Harry thought her dear to
him before; but now, as she lies there, so like death&rsquo;s
counterpart, a whole life of devotion would seem too
little to prove his appreciation of all her sacrifices.</p>

<p>The advent of the little stranger was viewed through
very different spectacles by different members of the
family. The doctor regarded it as a little automaton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for pleasant Æsculapian experiments in his idle hours;
the old lady viewed it as another barrier between herself
and Harry, and another tie to cement his already
too strong attachment for Ruth; and Betty groaned,
when she thought of the puny interloper, in connection
with washing and ironing days; and had already made
up her mind that the first time its nurse used her new
saucepan to make gruel, she would strike for higher
wages.</p>

<p>Poor, little, unconscious &ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; with thy velvet
cheek nestled up to as velvet a bosom, sleep on; thou
art too near heaven to know a taint of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ruth&rsquo;s</span> nurse, Mrs. Jiff, was fat, elephantine, and
unctuous. Nursing agreed with her. She had &ldquo;tasted&rdquo;
too many bowls of wine-whey on the stairs, tipped
up too many bottles of porter in the closet, slid down
too many slippery oysters before handing them to &ldquo;her
lady,&rdquo; not to do credit to her pantry devotions. Mrs.
Jiff wore an uncommonly stiff gingham gown, which
sounded, every time she moved, like the rustle of a
footfall among the withered leaves of autumn. Her
shoes were new, thick, and creaky, and she had a wheezy,
dilapidated-bellowsy way of breathing, consequent upon
the consumption of the above-mentioned port and oysters,
which was intensely crucifying to a sick ear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jiff always &ldquo;forgot to bring&rdquo; her own comb
and hair brush. She had a way, too, of opening drawers
and closets &ldquo;by mistake,&rdquo; thereby throwing her
helpless victim into a state of profuse perspiration.
Then she would go to sleep between the andirons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with the new baby on the edge of her knee, in alarming
proximity to the coals; would take a pinch of snuff
over the bowl of gruel in the corner, and knock down
the shovel, poker, and tongs, every time she went near
the fire; whispering&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;at the top of her
lungs, as she glanced in the direction of the bed, as if
its demented occupant were the guilty cause of the accident.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jiff had not nursed five-and-twenty years for
nothing. She particularly affected taking care of young
mothers, with their first babies; knowing very well that
her chain shortened, with every after addition to maternal
experience: she considered herself, therefore, quite lucky
in being called upon to superintend little Daisy&rsquo;s advent.</p>

<p>It <em>did</em> occasionally cross Ruth&rsquo;s mind as she lay, almost
fainting with exhaustion, on the pillow, while the
ravenous little Daisy cried, &ldquo;give, give,&rdquo; whether it took
Mrs. Jiff two hours to make <em>one</em> cup of tea, and brown
<em>one</em> slice of toast; Mrs. Jiff solacing herself, meanwhile,
over an omelette in the kitchen, with Betty, and pouring
into her ready ears whole histories of &ldquo;gen&rsquo;lemen as
wasn&rsquo;t gen&rsquo;lemen, whose ladies she nursed,&rdquo; and how
&ldquo;nobody but herself knew how late they <em>did</em> come
home when their wives were sick, though, to be sure,
she&rsquo;d scorn to tell of it!&rdquo; Sometimes, also, Ruth innocently
wondered if it was necessary for the nurse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
occupy the same bed with &ldquo;her lady;&rdquo; particularly when
her circumference was as Behemoth-ish, and her nose as
musical as Mrs. Jiff&rsquo;s; and whether there would be any
impropriety in her asking her to take the babe and keep
it quiet <em>part</em> of the night, that she might occasionally get
a nap. Sometimes, too, she considered the feasibility of
requesting Mrs. Jiff not to select the time when she
(Ruth) was sipping her chocolate, to comb out her
&ldquo;false front,&rdquo; and polish up her artificial teeth; and
sometimes she marvelled why, when Mrs. Jiff paid such
endless visits to the kitchen, she was always as fixed as
the North Star, whenever dear Harry came in to her
chamber to have a conjugal chat with her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;How</span> do you do this morning, Ruth?&rdquo; said the old
lady, lowering herself gradually into a softly-cushioned
arm chair. &ldquo;How your sickness <em>has</em> altered you!
You look like a ghost? I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you lost
all your hair; it is no uncommon thing in sickness; or
your teeth either. How&rsquo;s the baby? She don&rsquo;t favor
our side of the house at all. She is quite a plain child,
in fact. Has she any symptoms, yet, of a sore mouth?
I hope not, because she will communicate it to your
breast, and then you&rsquo;ll have a time of it. I knew a
poor, feeble thing once, who died of it. Of course, you
intend, when Mrs. Jiff leaves, to take care of the baby
yourself; a nursery girl would be very expensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Harry has already engaged one,&rdquo; said
Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has,&rdquo; said the old lady, sitting up
very straight, &ldquo;because it was only this morning that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the doctor and I figured up the expense it would be to
you, and we unanimously came to the conclusion to tell
Harry that you&rsquo;d better take care of the child yourself.
I always took care of my babies. You oughtn&rsquo;t to have
mentioned a nursery girl, at all, to Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He proposed it himself,&rdquo; replied Ruth; &ldquo;he said I
was too feeble to have the care of the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! pshaw! stuff! no such thing. You are well
enough, or will be, before long. Now, there&rsquo;s a girl&rsquo;s
board to begin with. Servant girls eat like boa-constrictors.
Then, there&rsquo;s the soap and oil she&rsquo;ll waste;&mdash;oh,
the thing isn&rsquo;t to be thought of; it is perfectly ruinous.
If you hadn&rsquo;t made a fool of Harry, he never
could have dreamed of it. You ought to have sense
enough to check him, when he would go into such extravagances
for you, but some people <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> any sense.
Where would all the sugar, and starch, and soap, go to,
I&rsquo;d like to know, if we were to have a second girl in the
house? How long would the wood-pile, or pitch-kindlings,
or our new copper-boiler last? And who is to
keep the back gate bolted, with such a chit flying in and
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please hand me that camphor bottle?&rdquo;
said Ruth, laying her hand upon her throbbing forehead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s my little snow-drop to-day?&rdquo; said Harry,
entering Ruth&rsquo;s room as his mother swept out; &ldquo;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ails your eyes, Ruth?&rdquo; said her husband, removing the
little hands which hid them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sudden pain,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing gaily; &ldquo;it has
gone now; the camphor was too strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good Ruth! brave Ruth! Was Harry deceived?
Something ails <em>his</em> eyes, now; but Ruth has too much
tact to notice it.</p>

<p>Oh Love! thou skilful teacher! learned beyond all
the wisdom of the schools.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;You</span> will be happy here, dear Ruth,&rdquo; said Harry;
&ldquo;you will be your own mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth danced about, from room to room, with the
careless glee of a happy child, quite forgetful that she
was a wife and a mother; quite unable to repress the
flow of spirits consequent upon her new-found freedom.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s new house was about five miles from the city.
The approach to it was through a lovely winding lane,
a little off the main road, skirted on either side by a
thick grove of linden and elms, where the wild grape-vine
leaped, clinging from branch to branch, festooning
its ample clusters in prodigal profusion of fruitage, and
forming a dense shade, impervious to the most garish
noon-day heat; while beneath, the wild brier-rose unfolded
its perfumed leaves in the hedges, till the bees
and humming-birds went reeling away, with their honeyed
treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>You can scarce see the house, for the drooping elms,
half a century old, whose long branches, at every wind-gust,
swept across the velvet lawn. The house is very
old, but Ruth says, &ldquo;All the better for that.&rdquo; Little
patches of moss tuft the sloping roof, and swallows and
martens twitter round the old chimney. It has nice old-fashioned
beams, running across the ceiling, which threaten
to bump Harry&rsquo;s curly head. The doorways, too,
are low, with honeysuckle, red and white, wreathed
around the porches; and back of the house there is a
high hill (which Ruth says must be terraced off for a
garden), surmounted by a gray rock, crowned by a
tumble-down old summer-house, where you have as fine
a prospect of hill and valley, rock and river, as ever a
sunset flooded with rainbow tints.</p>

<p>It was blessed to see the love-light in Ruth&rsquo;s gentle
eyes; to see the rose chase the lily from her cheek; to
see the old spring come back to her step; to follow her
from room to room, while she draped the pretty white
curtains, and beautified, unconsciously, everything her
fingers touched.</p>

<p>She could give an order without having it countermanded;
she could kiss little Daisy, without being
called &ldquo;silly;&rdquo; she could pull out her comb, and let
her curls flow about her face, without being considered
&ldquo;frivolous;&rdquo; and, better than all, she could fly into her
husband&rsquo;s arms, when he came home, and kiss him, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
feeling that she had broken any penal statute. Yes;
she was free as the golden orioles, whose hanging nests
swayed to and fro amid the glossy green leaves beneath
her window.</p>

<p>But not as thoughtless.</p>

<p>Ruth had a strong, earnest nature; she could not look
upon this wealth of sea, sky, leaf, bud, and blossom; she
could not listen to the little birds, nor inhale the perfumed
breath of morning, without a filling eye and brimming
heart, to the bounteous Giver. Should she revel
in all this loveliness,&mdash;should her heart be filled to its
fullest capacity for earthly happiness, and no grateful
incense go up from its altar to Heaven?</p>

<p>And the babe? Its wondering eyes had already begun
to seek its mother&rsquo;s; its little lip to quiver at a harsh
or discordant sound. An unpracticed hand must sweep
that harp of a thousand strings; trembling fingers must
inscribe, indelibly, on that blank page, characters to be
read by the light of eternity: the maternal eye must
never sleep at its post, lest the enemy rifle the casket of
its gems. And so, by her child&rsquo;s cradle, Ruth first
learned to pray. The weight her slender shoulders could
not bear, she rolled at the foot of the cross; and, with
the baptism of holy tears, mother and child were consecrated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Time</span> flew on; seasons came and went; and still peace
brooded, like a dove, under the roof of Harry and
Ruth. Each bright summer morning, Ruth and the little
Daisy,(who already partook of her mother&rsquo;s love for
nature,) rambled, hand in hand, through the woods and
fields, with a wholesome disregard of those city bug-bears,
sun, dew, bogs, fences, briers, and cattle. Wherever
a flower opened its blue eye in the rock cleft;
wherever the little stream ran, babbling and sparkling,
through the emerald meadow; where the golden moss
piled up its velvet cushion in the cool woods; where the
pretty clematis threw the graceful arms of youth &rsquo;round
the gnarled trunk of decay; where the bearded grain,
swaying to and fro, tempted to its death the reaper;
where the red and white clover dotted the meadow
grass; or where, in the damp marsh, the whip-poor-will
moaned, and the crimson lobelia nodded its regal crown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
or where the valley smiled in its beauty &rsquo;neath the
lofty hills, nestling &rsquo;mid its foliage the snow-white cottages;
or where the cattle dozed under the broad, green
branches, or bent to the glassy lake to drink; or where,
on the breezy hill-tops, the voices of childhood came up,
sweet and clear, as the far-off hymning of angels,&mdash;there,
Ruth and her soul&rsquo;s child loved to linger.</p>

<p>It was beautiful, yet fearful, to mark the kindling eye
of the child; to see the delicate flush come and go on
her marble cheek, and to feel the silent pressure of her
little hand, when this alone could tell the rapture she had
no words to express.</p>

<p>Ah, Ruth! gaze not so dotingly on those earnest eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking his spectacles from
his nose, and folding them up carefully in their
leathern case; &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be easy, Mis. Hall, now
that we&rsquo;ve toted out here, bag and baggage, to please
you, when I supposed I was settled for the rest of my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Fathers</em> can&rsquo;t be expected to have as much natural
affection, or to be as self-sacrificing as <em>mothers</em>,&rdquo; said the
old lady. &ldquo;Of course, it was some trouble to move out
here; but, for Harry&rsquo;s sake, I was willing to do it.
What does Ruth know about house-keeping, I&rsquo;d like to
know? A pretty muss she&rsquo;ll make of it, if <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not
around to oversee things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; retorted the doctor, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t
get any thanks for it&mdash;from <em>one</em> side of the house, at
least. Ruth never <em>says</em> anything when you vex her, but
there&rsquo;s a look in her eye which&mdash;well, Mis. Hall, it tells
the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it,&rdquo; said the old lady, while her very cap-strings
fluttered with indignation, &ldquo;and it has provoked
me a thousand times more than if she had thrown a
brick-bat at my head. That girl is no fool, doctor. She
knows very well what she is about: but diamond cut
diamond, <em>I</em> say. Doctor, doctor, there are the hens
in the garden. I want that garden kept nice. I suppose
Ruth thinks that nobody can have flowers but herself.
Wait till my china-asters and sweet peas come up.
I&rsquo;m going over to-day to take a peep round her house;
I wonder what it looks like? Stuck full of gimcracks,
of all sorts, I&rsquo;ll warrant. Well, I shan&rsquo;t furnish my best
parlor till I see what she has got. I&rsquo;ve laid by a little
money, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better give it to the missionaries, Mis. Hall,&rdquo;
growled the doctor; &ldquo;I tell you Ruth don&rsquo;t care a pin
what you have in your parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; muttered the doctor, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t get
the upper hand of <em>her</em> in that line; <abbr class="nc">i.&nbsp;e.</abbr>, if she has a mind
that you shall not. Harry is doing a very good business;
and you know very well, it is no use to try to
blind your eyes to it, that if she wanted Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
sceptre, he&rsquo;d manage to get it for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I can say of <em>you</em>,&rdquo; exclaimed the
old lady, fanning herself violently; &ldquo;for all that I used
to mend your old saddle-bags, and once made, with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
own hands, a pair of leather small-clothes to ride horseback
in. Forty years, doctor, I&rsquo;ve spent in your service.
I don&rsquo;t look much as I did when you married me.
I was said then to have &lsquo;woman&rsquo;s seven beauties,&rsquo; including
the &lsquo;dimple in the chin,&rsquo; which I see still remains;&rdquo;
and the old lady pointed to a slight indentation in her
wrinkled face. &ldquo;I might have had him that was Squire
Smith, or Pete Packer, or Jim Jessup. There wasn&rsquo;t
one of &rsquo;em who had not rather do the chores on <em>our</em> farm,
than on any other in the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be an old fool;
that was because your father kept good cider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s cap-strings were seen flying the next minute
through the sitting-room door; and the doctor was
heard to mutter, as she banged the door behind her,
&ldquo;<em>that</em> tells the whole story!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;A summer</span> house, hey!&rdquo; said the old lady, as with
stealthy, cat-like steps, she crossed a small piece of
woods, between her house and Ruth&rsquo;s; &ldquo;a summer
house! that&rsquo;s the way the money goes, is it? What
have we here? a book;&rdquo; (picking up a volume which
lay half hidden in the moss at her feet;) &ldquo;poetry, I declare!
the most frivolous of all reading; all pencil marked;&mdash;and
here&rsquo;s something in Ruth&rsquo;s own hand-writing&mdash;<em>that&rsquo;s</em>
poetry, too: worse and worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see how the <em>kitchen</em> of this poetess looks.
I will go into the house the back way, and take them by
surprise; that&rsquo;s the way to find people out. None of
your company faces for me.&rdquo; And the old lady peered
curiously through her spectacles, on either side, as she
passed along towards the kitchen door, and exclaimed, as
her eye fell on the shining row, &ldquo;<em>six</em> milkpans!&mdash;wonder
if they <em>buy</em> their milk, or keep a cow. If they buy it, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
must cost them something; if they keep a cow, I&rsquo;ve no
question the milk is half wasted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady passed her skinny forefinger across one
of the pans, examining her finger very minutely after
the operation; and then applied the tip of her nose to
the interior of it. There was no fault to be found with
that milkpan, if it was Ruth&rsquo;s; so, scrutinizing two or
three dish towels, which were hanging on a line to dry,
she stepped cautiously up to the kitchen door. A tidy, respectable-looking
black woman met her on the threshold;
her woolly locks bound with a gay-striped bandanna,
and her ebony face shining with irresistible good
humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Ruth in?&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, Missis?&rdquo; said Dinah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missis Hall lives <em>here</em>,&rdquo; answered Dinah, with a puzzled
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;she is my son&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon, Missis,&rdquo; said Dinah, curtseying
respectfully. &ldquo;I never heard her name called
Ruth afore: massa calls her &lsquo;bird,&rsquo; and &lsquo;sunbeam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she at home?&rdquo; she repeated, with stately dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dinah, &ldquo;Missis is gone rambling off in
the woods with little Daisy. She&rsquo;s powerful fond of
flowers, and things. She climbs fences like a squir&rsquo;l!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it makes this chil&rsquo; laf&rsquo; to see the ol&rsquo; farmers stare at
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have a great deal to do, here;&rdquo; said the
old lady, frowning; &ldquo;Ruth isn&rsquo;t much of a hand at
house-work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty to do, Missis, and willin&rsquo; hands to do it.
Dinah don&rsquo;t care how hard she works, if she don&rsquo;t work
to the tune of a lash; and Missis Hall goes singing
about the house so that it makes time fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t ever <em>help</em> you any, does she?&rdquo; said the
persevering old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless you! yes, Missis. She comes right in
and makes a pie for Massa Harry, or cooks a steak jess&rsquo;
as easy as she pulls off a flower; and when Dinah&rsquo;s cooking
anything new, she asks more questions how it&rsquo;s done
than this chil&rsquo; kin answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a great deal of company, I suppose; that
must make you extra trouble, I should think; people
riding out from the city to supper, when you are all
through and cleared away: don&rsquo;t it tire you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Missis Hall takes it easy. She laf&rsquo;s merry,
and says to the company, &lsquo;you get <em>tea</em> enough in the
city, so I shan&rsquo;t give you any; we had tea long ago; but
here&rsquo;s some fresh milk, and some raspberries and cake;
and if you can&rsquo;t eat <em>that</em>, you ought to go hungry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She irons Harry&rsquo;s shirts, I suppose?&rdquo; said the old
lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She? s&rsquo;pose dis chil&rsquo; let her? when she&rsquo;s so careful,
too, of ol&rsquo; Dinah&rsquo;s bones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old lady, foiled at all points, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
walk over the house a bit, I guess; I won&rsquo;t trouble you
to wait on me, Dinah;&rdquo; and the old lady started on her
exploring tour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;This</span> is the parlor, hey?&rdquo; soliloquized old Mrs.
Hall, as she seated herself on the sofa. &ldquo;A few
dollars laid out here, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not so fast, my dear madam. Examine closely. Those
long, white curtains, looped up so prettily from the open
windows, are plain, cheap muslin; but no artist could
have disposed their folds more gracefully. The chairs
and sofas, also, Ruth covered with her own nimble fingers:
the room has the fragrance of a green-house, to be
sure; but if you examine the flowers, which are scattered
so profusedly round, you will find they are <em>wild</em>
flowers, which Ruth, basket in hand, climbs many a stone
fence every morning to gather; and not a country boy
in the village knows their hiding-places as well as she.
See how skilfully they are arranged! with what an
eye to the blending of colors! How dainty is that little
tulip-shaped vase, with those half opened wild-rose buds!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
see that little gilt saucer, containing only a few tiny
green leaves; yet, mark their exquisite shape and finish.
And there are some wood anemonies; some white,
with a faint blush of pink at the petals; and others blue
as little Daisy&rsquo;s eyes; and see that velvet moss, with its
gold-star blossoms!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must take a deal of time to gather and fix &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
muttered the old lady.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear madam; but, better pay the shoe-maker&rsquo;s
than the doctor&rsquo;s bill; better seek health in
hunting live flowers, than ruin it by manufacturing those
German worsted abortions.</p>

<p>You should see your son Harry, as he ushers a
visitor in through the low door-way, and stands back to
mark the surprised delight with which he gazes upon
Ruth&rsquo;s little fairy room. You should see how Harry&rsquo;s
eyes glisten, as they pass from one flower vase to another,
saying, &ldquo;Who but Ruth would ever have spied out
<em>that</em> tiny little blossom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And little Daisy has caught the flower mania, too;
and every day she must have <em>her</em> vase in the collection;
now withdrawing a rose and replacing it with a violet,
and then stepping a pace or two back and looking at it
with her little head on one side, as knowingly as an
artist looks at the finishing touches to a favorite picture.</p>

<p>But, my dear old lady, we beg pardon; we are keeping
you too long from that china closet, which you are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
anxious to inspect; hoping to find a flaw, either in crockery
or cake. Not a bit! You may draw those prying
fingers across the shelves till you are tired, and not a
particle of dust will adhere to them. Neither cups, saucers,
tumblers, nor plates, stick to your hands; the sugar-bowl
is covered; the cake, in that tin pail, is fresh and
light; the preserves, in those glass jars, tied down with
brandy papers, are clear as amber; and the silver might
serve for a looking-glass, in which you could read your
own vexation.</p>

<p>Never mind! A great many people keep the <em>first</em>
floor spick and span; mayhap you&rsquo;ll find something
wrong <em>up</em> stairs. Walk in; &rsquo;tis the &ldquo;best chamber.&rdquo;
A gilt arrow is fastened to the wall, and pretty white
lace curtains are thrown (tent fashion) over it; there is
a snow-white quilt and a pair of plump, tempting pillows;
the furniture and carpet are of a light cream
color; and there is a vase of honeysuckle on the little
light-stand. Nothing could be more faultless, you see.</p>

<p>Now, step into the nursery; the floor is strewed with
play-things; thank God, there&rsquo;s a child in the house!
There is a broken doll; a torn picture-book; a little
wreath of oak leaves; a dandelion chain; some willow
tassels; a few acorns; a little red shoe, full of parti-colored
pebbles; the wing of a little blue-bird; two
little, speckled eggs, on a tuft of moss; and a little
orphan chicken, nestling in a basket of cotton wool, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the corner. Then, there is a work-basket of Ruth&rsquo;s with
a little dress of Daisy&rsquo;s, partly finished, and a dicky of
Harry&rsquo;s, with the needle still sticking in it, which the
little gypsey wife intends finishing when she comes back
from her wood ramble.</p>

<p>The old lady begins to think she must give it up;
when, luckily, her eye falls on a crouching &ldquo;Venus,&rdquo; in
the corner. Saints and angels! why, she has never been
to the dress-makers! There&rsquo;s a text, now! What a
pity there is no appreciative audience to see the glow of
indignation with which those half averted eyes regard the
undraped goddess!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry! is this the end of all my teachings?
Well, it is all <em>Ruth&rsquo;s</em> doings&mdash;<em>all</em> Ruth&rsquo;s doings. Harry
is to be pitied, not blamed;&rdquo; and the old lady takes up,
at length, her <em>triumphant</em> march for home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Hallo!</span> what are you doing there?&rdquo; exclaimed the
doctor, looking over the fence at a laborer, at work
in one of Harry&rsquo;s fields.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ploughing this bit o&rsquo; ground, sir. Mr. Hall told
me to be sure and get it finished before he came home
from the city this afthernoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;I was born sometime
before my son Harry; put up your plough, and lay
that bit of stone wall yonder; that needs to be done
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking Masther Hall won&rsquo;t be afther liking it if
I do, sir,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;I had my orders for the day&rsquo;s
work before masther went to the city, sir, this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said the old man, unchaining the horse
from the plough, and turning him loose in the pasture;
&ldquo;young folks <em>think</em> old folks are fools; old folks <em>know</em>
young folks to be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Pat eyed the doctor, scratched his head, and began
slowly to lay the stone wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <em>that</em> fellow doing over yonder?&rdquo; said the doctor
to Pat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Planting corn, yer honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corn? ha! ha! city farming! Good. Corn? That&rsquo;s
just the spot for potatoes. <strong title="Hallo">H-a-l-l-o</strong> there! Don&rsquo;t
plant any more corn in that spot, John; it never&rsquo;ll
come to anything&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Hall?&rdquo; said John, hesitatingly, leaning on
his hoe-handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry? Oh, never mind him. He has seen more
ledgers than corn. Corn? Ha! that&rsquo;s good. You can
go cart that load of gravel up the hill. What a fortunate
thing for Harry, that I am here to oversee things. This
amateur farming is pretty play enough; but the way it
sinks the money is more curious than profitable. I wonder,
now, if that tree is grafted right. I&rsquo;ll take off the
ligatures and see. That hedge won&rsquo;t grow, I&rsquo;m certain;
the down-east cedars thrive the best for hedges. I
may as well pull these up, and tell Harry to get some
of the other kind;&rdquo; and the doctor pulled them up by the
roots, and threw them over the fence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Time</span> for papa to come,&rdquo; said little Daisy, seating
herself on the low door-step; &ldquo;the sun has crept
way round to the big apple-tree;&rdquo; and Daisy shook back
her hair, and settling her little elbows on her knees, sat
with her chin in her palms, dreamily watching the shifting
clouds. A butterfly alights on a blade of grass
near her: Daisy springs up, her long hair floating like
a veil about her shoulders, and her tiny feet scarce bending
the clover blossoms, and tiptoes carefully along in
pursuit.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s gone, Daisy, but never mind; like many other
coveted treasures, he would lose his brilliancy if caught.
Daisy has found something else; she closes her hand over
it, and returns to her old watch-post on the door-step.
She seats herself again, and loosing her tiny hold, out
creeps a great, bushy, yellow caterpillar. Daisy places
him carefully on the back of her little, blue-veined hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and he commences his travels up the polished arm, to
the little round shoulder. When he reaches the lace
sleeve, Daisy&rsquo;s laugh rings out like a robin&rsquo;s carol; then she
puts him back, to retravel the same smooth road again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daisy! Daisy!&rdquo; said Ruth, stepping up behind
her, &ldquo;what an <em>ugly</em> playfellow; put him down, do darling;
I cannot bear to see him on your arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;<em>God</em> made him,&rdquo; said little Daisy, with sweet,
upturned eyes of wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, darling,&rdquo; said Ruth, in a hushed whisper, kissing
the child&rsquo;s brow, with a strange feeling of awe.
&ldquo;Keep him, Daisy, dear, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Please</span>, sir, I&rsquo;ll be afther leaving the night,&rdquo; said
John, scraping out his hind foot, as Harry drew
rein on Romeo, and halted under a large apple-tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave?&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, patting Romeo&rsquo;s neck;
&ldquo;you seemed a contented fellow enough when I left for
the city this morning. Don&rsquo;t your wages suit? What&rsquo;s
in the wind now? out with it, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John scratched his head, kicked away a pebble with
the toe of his brogan, looked up, and looked down,
and finally said, (lowering his voice to a confidential
whisper, as he glanced in the direction of the doctor&rsquo;s
cottage;) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ould gintleman, sir, savin&rsquo; yer presence.
It is not <em>two</em> masthers Pat would be afther having;&rdquo;
and Pat narrated the affair of the plough.</p>

<p>Harry bit his lip, and struck Romeo a little quick cut
with his riding-whip. Harry was one of the most dutiful
of sons, and never treated his father with disrespect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he had chosen a separate home, that he might be master
of it; and this old annoyance in a new shape was very
provoking. &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;there is only one
master here; when <em>I</em> give you an order, you are to stick
to it, till you get a different one from me. D&rsquo;ye understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Holy Mother, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Pat, delightedly
resuming his hoe with fresh vigor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s</span> the fourth gig that has been tied to Harry&rsquo;s
fence, since dinner,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;I hope
Harry&rsquo;s business will continue to prosper. Company,
company, company. And there&rsquo;s Ruth, as I live, romping
round that meadow, without a bit of a bonnet. Now
she&rsquo;s climbing a cherry-tree. A <em>married woman</em> climbing
a cherry-tree! Doctor, do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot &rsquo;em down,&rdquo; said the doctor, abstractedly, without
lifting his eyes from the Almanac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot <em>who</em> down?&rdquo; said the old lady, shaking him
by the shoulder. &ldquo;I said that romp of a Ruth was up in
a cherry-tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought you were talking of those thievish
robins stealing the cherries,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;as to
Ruth I&rsquo;ve given her up long ago; <em>she</em> never will settle
down to anything. Yesterday, as I was taking a walk
over Harry&rsquo;s farm to see if things were not all going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the dogs, I saw her down in the meadow yonder, with
her shoes and stockings off, wading through a little brook
to get at some flowers, which grew on the other side.
Half an hour after she came loitering up the road, with
her bonnet hanging on the back of her neck, and her
apron crammed full of grasses, and herbs, and branches,
and all sorts of green trash. Just then the minister
came along. I was glad of it. Good enough for her,
thinks I to myself; she&rsquo;ll blush for once. Well, what
do you think she did, Mis. Hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; said the old lady, in a sepulchral whisper,
dropping her knitting-needles and drawing her rocking-chair
within kissing distance of the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she burst out a-laughing, perched herself on
top of a stone wall, took a great big leaf to fan herself,
and then invited the minister to sit down &rsquo;long side of
her, <em>jest</em> as easy as if her hair wasn&rsquo;t all flying round
her face like a wild Arab&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give up now,&rdquo; said the old lady, dropping her
hands in an attitude of the extremest dejection; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no hope of her after that; and what is worse, it is no use
talking to Harry; she&rsquo;s got him so bewitched that he
imagines everything she does is right. How she did it,
passes me. I&rsquo;m sure she has no beauty. I&rsquo;ve no patience
to see Harry twisting those yellow curls of hers
round his fingers, and calling them &lsquo;threads of gold;&rsquo;
threads of fiddlesticks! She&rsquo;d look a deal more proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
like, if she&rsquo;d wear her hair smooth behind her ears, as
I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your hair is false,&rdquo; said the literal doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the old lady, snapping her eyes, &ldquo;I
never can argue with you but you are sure to get off the
track, sooner or later; there is no need of your telling
all, you know. Suppose I was always alluding to your
wig, how would you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Winter</span> had set in. The snow in soft, white piles,
barred up the cottage door, and hung shelving over
the barn-roof and fences; while every tiny twig and
branch bent heavily, with its soft fleecy burthen. &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;
was to go to the city that morning in a sleigh.
Daisy had already heard the bells tinkling at the barn-door,
as Pat necklaced Romeo, who stood pawing and
snorting, as if it were fine fun to plough five miles of
unbroken road into the city. Daisy had turned Papa&rsquo;s
over-coat sleeves inside out, and warmed them thoroughly
at the fire; she had tied on his moccasins, and
had thrown his fur collar round his neck; and now she
stood holding his warm cap and furred gloves, while he
and mamma were saying their usual good-bye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of that cough, Daisy,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
come to the door, darling, to breathe in this keen air.
Kiss your hand to papa, from the window;&rdquo; and Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
scratched the frost away with his finger nails from the
window-pane, that Daisy might see him start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed the child, as Pat tossed
the bright, scarlet-lined buffalo robe into the sleigh, and
tucked the corners snugly over his master&rsquo;s feet, and
Romeo, inspirited by the merry tinkle of the bells and
the keen frosty air, stood on his hind legs and playfully
held up his fore feet; &ldquo;Oh, how pretty!&rdquo; Harry turned
his head as he gathered the reins in his hand; his cap
was crowded down so snugly over his forehead, and his
fur collar turned up so closely about his chin, that only
a glimpse of his dark eye and fine Roman nose was
visible. One wave of the hand, and the light, feathery
snow flew, on either side, from under Romeo&rsquo;s flying
heels&mdash;and Papa was out of sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Why</span> in the world, Ruth, are you wandering about
there, like a ghost, in the moonlight?&rdquo; said Harry,
rubbing open his sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hist, Harry! listen to Daisy&rsquo;s breathing; it sounds
as if it came through a brazen tube. She must be ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little wife, don&rsquo;t torment yourself. She has only a
bad cold, which, of course, appears worse at night. Her
breathing is irregular, because her head is too low. Give
her this pillow: there; now she&rsquo;s comfortable. What a
frightened little puss you are! Your hand trembles as if
you had the palsy; now go to sleep; it must be near
two o&rsquo;clock; you&rsquo;ll be sick yourself to-morrow:&rdquo; and
Harry, wearied out with an annoying day of business,
was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Only the eye of God watches like a mother&rsquo;s. Ruth
could not sleep. She was soon again at Daisy&rsquo;s side,
with her fingers upon her wrist, and her eye fixed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the child&rsquo;s face; marking every contortion of feature,
noting every change of posture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, darling?&rdquo; asked her mother, as Daisy
grasped her throat with both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>Ruth glanced at Harry. He was so weary, it were a
pity to wake him needlessly. Perhaps her fears were
groundless, and she was over-anxious; and then, perhaps,
Daisy really needed <em>immediate</em> medical aid.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s fears preponderated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Harry,&rdquo; said she, laying her hand softly on his
forehead, &ldquo;do call up Pat, and send for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you think best,&rdquo; said Harry, springing
up; &ldquo;but it is a cold night for the old man to come out;
and really, Ruth, Daisy has only a stuffed cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Please</em> let Pat go,&rdquo; said Ruth, pleadingly; &ldquo;I shall
feel happier, Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a venturous undertaking to rouse Pat suddenly,
as his bump of destructiveness generally woke first; and
a fight seemed always with him a necessary preliminary
to a better understanding of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold! hold!&rdquo; said Harry, seizing his brawny, belligerent
fists; &ldquo;not quite so fast man; open your eyes,
and see who I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I sthrike yer honor?&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;I hope yer&rsquo;ll
forgive me; but you see, I was jist born with my fists
doubled up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said his master, laughing; &ldquo;but get on
your clothes as soon as possible; harness Romeo, and
bring the old gentleman up here. Mrs. Hall feels very
uneasy about Daisy, and wants him to prescribe for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him back in a flash,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;but what&rsquo;ll
I do if he won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? what do you want? Speak quick, if
you&rsquo;ve anything to say, for I&rsquo;m catching the rheumatiz&rsquo;
in my head;&rdquo; said the doctor, as he poked his bald poll
out the cottage window, into the frosty night air. &ldquo;Who
are you? and what on earth do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Pat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s me?&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Botheration,&rdquo; growled Pat; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t the ould owl
know the voice of me?&mdash;It&rsquo;s Pat Donahue; the childer
is sick, and Misthress Ruth wants you to come wid me,
and give her something to betther her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! is that all you woke me up for? The
child was well enough this noon, except a slight cold.
Ruth is full of notions. Go home and take that bottle,
and tell her to give Daisy half a teaspoonful once in two
hours; and I&rsquo;ll come over in the morning. She&rsquo;s always
a-fussing with that child, and thinking, if she sneezes,
that she is going to die. It&rsquo;s a wonder if I don&rsquo;t die myself,
routed out of a warm bed, without my wig, this time
of night. There&mdash;there&mdash;go along, and mind you shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the gate after you. Ten to one he&rsquo;ll leave it open,&rdquo; soliloquized
the doctor, slamming down the window with a
jerk. &ldquo;I hate an Irishman as I do a rattlesnake. An
Irishman is an incomplete biped&mdash;a human tower of
Babel; he was finished up to a certain point, and there
he was left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis. Hall! Mis. Hall! if you&rsquo;ve no objection, I
should like you to stop snoring. I should like to sleep,
if the village of Glenville will let me. Dear, dear, what
a thing it is to be a doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;If</span> de las&rsquo; day <em>has</em> come, dis chil&rsquo; ought to know it,&rdquo;
said Dinah, springing to her feet and peering out,
as she scratched away the frost from the window; &ldquo;has
de debbel broke loose? or only de horse? Any way,
&rsquo;tis about de same ting;&rdquo; and she glanced in the direction
of the barn. &ldquo;Massy sakes! dere&rsquo;s Pat stealing off
in de night wid Romeo; no he aint neider&mdash;he&rsquo;s putting
him up in de barn. Where you s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s been dis
time o&rsquo; night? <em>Courting</em> p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps! Well, dis chil&rsquo; dunno.
And dere&rsquo;s a bright light shining on de snow, from Massa
Harry&rsquo;s window. Dinah can&rsquo;t sleep till she knows
what&rsquo;s to pay, dat&rsquo;s a fac&rsquo;;&rdquo; and tying a handkerchief
over her woolly head, and throwing on a shawl, she
tramped down stairs. &ldquo;Massy sakes!&rdquo; said she, stopping
on the landing, as Daisy&rsquo;s shrill cough fell on
her ear; &ldquo;Massy! jes&rsquo; hear dat!&rdquo; and opening the chamber-door,
Dinah stood staring at the child, with distended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
eye-balls, then looking from Harry to Ruth, as if she
thought them both under the influence of night-mare.
&ldquo;For de <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> sake, Massa Harry, send for de doctor,&rdquo;
said Dinah, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said Harry, trying to coax Daisy to
swallow another spoonful of the medicine, &ldquo;and he said
he&rsquo;d be here in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>She won&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; said Dinah, in a low, hoarse whisper to
Harry, as she pointed to Daisy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <em>know</em>,
Massa, it&rsquo;s de croup! de croup; de <em>wu&rsquo;st</em> way, Massa!
<em>Oh</em> Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry was harnessing Romeo in an instant, and on his
way to the doctor&rsquo;s cottage. In vain he knocked, and
rang, and thumped. The old man, comfortably tucked
up between the blankets, was far away in the land of
dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;I must tie
Romeo to the post and climb in at the kitchen-window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father! father!&rdquo; said he, shaking the old gentleman
by the shoulders, &ldquo;Daisy is worse, and I want you to go
right home with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you are only
frightened; it&rsquo;s an awful cold night to go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but I brought two buffaloes;
hurry, father. Daisy is <em>very</em> sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old doctor groaned; took his wig from the bed
post, and put it on his head; tied a woollen muffler, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
distressing deliberation, over his unbelieving ears, and,
returning four times to tell &ldquo;Mis. Hall to be sure and bolt
the front door after him,&rdquo; climbed into the sleigh. &ldquo;I
shall be glad if I don&rsquo;t get a sick spell myself,&rdquo; said
the doctor, &ldquo;coming out this freezing night. Ruth has
frightened you to death, I s&rsquo;pose. Ten to one when I get
up there, nothing will ail the child. Come, come, don&rsquo;t
drive so fast; my bones are old, and I don&rsquo;t believe in
these gay horses of yours, who never make any use of
their fore-legs, except to hold them up in the air. Whoa,
I say&mdash;Romeo, whoa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out de way, Pat!&rdquo; said Dinah; &ldquo;your Paddy
fingers are all thumbs. Here, put some more water in
dat kettle dere; now stir dat mustard paste; now run
quick wid dat goose-grease up to Missus, and tell her to
rub de chil&rsquo;s troat wid it; &rsquo;t aint no use, though. Oh,

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Stamping</span> the snow from his feet, the doctor slowly
untied his woollen muffler, took off his hat, settled
his wig, hung his overcoat on a nail in the entry, drew
from his pocket a huge red handkerchief, and announcing
his arrival by a blast, loud enough to arouse the seven
sleepers, followed Harry up stairs to the sick chamber.</p>

<p>The strong fire-light fell upon Ruth&rsquo;s white figure, as
she sat, pale and motionless, in the corner, with Daisy on
her lap, whose laborious breathing could be distinctly
heard in the next room. A dark circle had settled round
the child&rsquo;s mouth and eyes, and its little hands hung helplessly
at its side. Dinah was kneeling at the hearth, stirring
a fresh mustard paste, with an air which seemed to
say, &ldquo;it is no use, but I must keep on doing something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor advanced, drew his spectacles from their
leathern case, perched them astride the end of his nose,
and gazed steadily at Daisy without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Help her</em>,&rdquo; said Ruth, imploringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to be done,&rdquo; said the doctor, in an unmoved
tone, staring at Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come afore, den?&rdquo; said Dinah,
springing to her feet and confronting the doctor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see you&rsquo;ve murdered <em>two</em> of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; and she pointed
to Ruth, whose head had dropped upon her breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Harry, it&rsquo;s no use to call another doctor,&rdquo;
said his father, shaking off his grasp; &ldquo;the child is
struck with death; let her drop off quietly; what&rsquo;s the
sense of tormenting her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry shuddered, and drew his father again to Daisy&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help her,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk; try <em>something</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can put on these leeches, if you insist,&rdquo; said
the old man, uncorking a bottle; &ldquo;but I tell you, it is
only tormenting the dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dinah cut open the child&rsquo;s night dress, and bared the
fair, round chest, to which the leeches clung eagerly;
Daisy, meanwhile, remaining motionless, and seemingly
quite insensible to the disagreeable pricking sensation
they caused.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other doctor is below,&rdquo; whispered Pat, thrusting
his head in at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him up,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>An expression of pain passed over the young man&rsquo;s
features as his eye fell upon the child. As yet, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not become so professionally hardened, as to be able to
look unmoved upon the group before him, whose imploring
eyes asked vainly of him the help no mortal hand
could give.</p>

<p>A few questions he asked to avoid being questioned
himself; a few remedies he tried, to appease the mother&rsquo;s
heart, whose mournful eyes were on him like a spell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; said Daisy, faintly, as she languidly opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be thanked,&rdquo; said Ruth, overcome by the sound
of that blessed little voice, which she never expected to
hear again, &ldquo;God be thanked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young doctor returned no answering smile, as
Ruth and Harry grasped his hand; but he walked to the
little window and looked out upon the gray dawn, with a
heavy sigh, as the first faint streak of light ushered in the
new-born day.</p>

<p>Still the fire-light flashed and flickered&mdash;now upon the
old doctor, who had fallen asleep in his arm chair; now
upon Ruth&rsquo;s bowed head; now upon Daisy, who lay motionless
in her mother&rsquo;s lap, (the deadly paleness of her
countenance rendered still more fearful by the dark
blood-stains on her night dress;) then upon Harry, who,
kneeling at Daisy&rsquo;s side, and stifling his own strong
heart, gazed alternately at mother and child; then upon
Dinah, who, with folded arms, stood like some grim sentinel,
in the shadow of the farther corner; the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
mantle clock, meanwhile, ticking, ticking on&mdash;numbering
the passing moments with startling distinctness.</p>

<p>Oh, in such an hour, when wave after wave of anguish
dashes over us, where are the infidel&rsquo;s boasted doubts, as
the tortured heart cries out, instinctively, &ldquo;save, Lord;
or we perish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the night waned, and the stars paled. Up the
gray east the golden sun slowly glided. One beam penetrated
the little window, hovering like a halo over Daisy&rsquo;s
sunny head. A quick, convulsive start, and with one
wild cry (as the little throat filled to suffocation), the fair
white arms were tossed aloft, then dropped powerless upon
the bed of Death!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;There</span> can be no sorrow greater than this sorrow,&rdquo;
sobbed Ruth, as the heavy sod fell on Daisy&rsquo;s little
breast.</p>

<p>In after years, when bitterer cups had been drained to
the dregs, Ruth remembered these, her murmuring words.
Ah! mourning mother! He who seeth the end from the
beginning, even in this blow &ldquo;remembered mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter-in-law is quite crushed by her affliction,
I hear,&rdquo; said a neighbor to old Mrs. Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Jones, I think she is,&rdquo; said the old lady
complacently. &ldquo;It has taken right hold of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It died of croup, I believe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they <em>say</em> so,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;It is <em>my</em>
opinion the child&rsquo;s death was owing to the thriftlessness
of the mother. I don&rsquo;t mourn for it, because I believe
the poor thing is better off.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones. &ldquo;I always had
the impression that young Mrs. Hall was a pattern
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People differ,&rdquo; said the old lady, raising her eyebrows,
compressing her lips, and looking mysteriously at
the ceiling, as if she <em>could</em> tell a tale, were she not too
charitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the amount of it is,&rdquo; said the garrulous old
doctor, emerging from the corner; &ldquo;the amount of it is,
that the mother always thought she knew better than
anybody else how to manage that child. Now, you
know, Mis. Jones, I&rsquo;m a physician, and <em>ought</em> to know
something about the laws that govern the human body,
but you&rsquo;ll be astonished to hear that she frequently acted
directly contrary to my advice, and this is the result;
that tells the whole story. However, as Mis. Hall says,
the child is better off; and as to Ruth, why the Lord
generally sends afflictions where they are <em>needed</em>;&rdquo; and
the doctor returned to his corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks very lonely at the Glen since they moved
away,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Jones. &ldquo;I suppose they don&rsquo;t
think of coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; replied the doctor, re-appearing from his
corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose your son and his wife have no idea of returning
to the Glen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. Ruth is one of the uneasy kind; it&rsquo;s coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and going&mdash;coming and going with her. She fancied
everything in doors and out reminded her of Daisy, and
kept wandering round, trying to be rid of herself. Now
that proves she didn&rsquo;t make a sanctifying use of her
trouble. It&rsquo;s no use trying to dodge what the Lord
sends. We&rsquo;ve just got to stand and take it; if we
don&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll be sending something else. Them&rsquo;s my sentiments,
and I consider &rsquo;em scripteral. I shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if <em>Harry</em> was taken away from her;&mdash;a poor,
miserable thing she&rsquo;d be to take care of herself, if he
was. She couldn&rsquo;t earn the salt to her porridge.
Thriftless, Mis. Jones, thriftless&mdash;come of a bad stock&mdash;can&rsquo;t
expect good fruit off a wild apple tree, at least, not
without grace is grafted on; that tells the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; my heart aches for her,&rdquo; said the kind Mrs.
Jones. &ldquo;Mrs. Hall is very delicately organized,&mdash;one of
those persons capable of compressing the happiness or
misery of a lifetime into a few moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;stuff; don&rsquo;t believe it.
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> an example to the contrary. I&rsquo;ve been through
everything, and just look at me;&rdquo; and the doctor advanced
a pace or two to give Mrs. Jones a better view of
his full-blown peony face, and aldermanic proportions;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t believe it, Mis. Jones; stuff! Fashion to be
sentimental; nerves a modern invention. Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the persistent Mrs. Jones, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think, doctor, that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think anything <em>about</em> it,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to <em>hear</em> anything about it. Have no patience
with any woman who&rsquo;d let a husband sell a farm
at such a sacrifice as Harry&rsquo;s was sold, merely because
there was a remote chance she would become insane if
she staid there. Now, I&rsquo;ve enough to do&mdash;plenty to do,
but, still, I was willing to superintend that farm a little,
as my doing so was such a help to Harry. Well, well;
they&rsquo;ll both go to the dogs, that&rsquo;s the amount of it. A
rolling stone gathers no moss. Harry was good for
something before he married Ruth; had a mind of his
own. Ruth aint the wife for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not appear to think so,&rdquo; replied the obstinate
Mrs. Jones. &ldquo;Everybody in the village says, &lsquo;what a
happy couple they are.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>O-o-h</em>&mdash;my!&rdquo; hissed the old lady, &ldquo;did you <em>ever</em>,
doctor? Of course, Mrs. Jones, you don&rsquo;t suppose
Harry would be such a fool as to tell people how miserable
he was; but <em>mothers</em>, Mrs. Jones, <em>mothers</em> are keen-sighted;
can&rsquo;t throw dust in a <em>mother&rsquo;s</em> eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nor in mine</em>,&rdquo; retorted the independent Mrs. Jones,
with a mock courtesy to the old lady, as she walked out
the door, muttering as she went down the road, &ldquo;Sally
Jones will tell her the truth if nobody else will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis. Hall,&rdquo; said the doctor, drawing himself up so
straight as to snap off his waist-band button, &ldquo;this is the
last time that woman ever crosses <em>my</em> threshold. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tell Deacon Smith that I consider her a proper subject
for church discipline; she&rsquo;s what the bible calls &lsquo;a busy body
in other men&rsquo;s matters;&rsquo; a character which both
you and I despise and abominate, Mis. Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> <em>first-born</em>! Oh, other tiny feet may trip lightly
at the hearth-stone; other rosy faces may greet us
round the board; with tender love we soothe their
childish pains and share their childish sports; but &ldquo;Benjamin
is not,&rdquo; is written in the secret chamber of many
a bereaved mother&rsquo;s heart, where never more the echo
of a childish voice may ring out such liquid music as
death hath hushed.</p>

<p>Spring had garlanded the earth with flowers, and
Autumn had withered them with his frosty breath.
Many a Summer&rsquo;s sun, and many a Winter&rsquo;s snow, had
rested on Daisy&rsquo;s grave, since the date of our last chapter.</p>

<p>At the window of a large hotel in one of those seaport
towns, the resort alike of the invalid and pleasure-seeker,
sat Ruth; the fresh sea-breeze lifting her hair from temples
thinner and paler than of yore, but stamped with a
holier beauty. From the window might be seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
blue waters of the bay leaping to the bright sunlight; while
many a vessel outward and inward bound, spread its
sails, like some joyous white-winged sea bird. But Ruth
was not thinking of the sapphire sky, though it were passing
fair; nor of the blue sea, decked with its snowy sails;
for in her lap lay a little half-worn shoe, with the impress
of a tiny foot, upon which her tears were falling fast.</p>

<p><em>A little half-worn shoe!</em> And yet no magician could
conjure up such blissful visions; no artist could trace
such vivid pictures; no harp of sweetest sounds could so
fill the ear with music.</p>

<p>Eight years since the little Daisy withered! And yet,
to the mother&rsquo;s eye, she still blossomed fair as Paradise.
The soft, golden hair still waved over the blue-veined
temples; the sweet, earnest eyes still beamed with their
loving light; the little fragile hand was still outstretched
for maternal guidance, and in the wood and by the
stream they still lingered. Still, the little hymn was
chanted at dawn, the little prayer lisped at dew-fall; still,
that gentle breathing mingled with the happy mother&rsquo;s
star-lit dreams.</p>

<p>A little, bright-eyed creature, crept to Ruth&rsquo;s side, and
lifting a long, wavy, golden ringlet from a box on the
table near her, laid it beside her own brown curls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daisy&rsquo;s in heaven,&rdquo; said little Katy, musingly.
&ldquo;Why do you cry, mamma? Don&rsquo;t you like to have
God keep her for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A tear was the only answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> should like to die, and have you love <em>my</em> curls as
you do Daisy&rsquo;s, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth started, and looked at the child; the rosy flush
had faded away from little Katy&rsquo;s cheek, and a tear stole
slowly from beneath her long lashes.</p>

<p>Taking her upon her lap, she severed one tress of her
brown hair, and laid it beside little Daisy&rsquo;s golden ringlet.</p>

<p>A bright, glad smile lit up little Katy&rsquo;s face, and she
was just throwing her arms about her mother&rsquo;s neck, to
express her thanks, when, stopping suddenly, she drew
from her dimpled foot one little shoe, and laid it in her
mother&rsquo;s palm.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Mid smiles and tears Ruth complied with the mute request;
and the little sister shoes lay with the twin ringlets,
lovingly side by side.</p>

<p>Blessed childhood! the pupil and yet the teacher; half
infant, half sage, and whole angel! what a desert were
earth without thee!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Hotel</span> life is about the same in every latitude. At
Beach Cliff there was the usual number of vapid,
fashionable mothers; dressy, brainless daughters; half-fledged
wine-bibbing sons; impudent, whisker-dyed
roués; bachelors, anxious to give their bashfulness an
airing; bronchial clergymen, in search of health and a
text; waning virgins, languishing by candle-light; gouty
uncles, dyspeptic aunts, whist-playing old ladies, flirting
nursery maids and neglected children.</p>

<p>Then there were &ldquo;hops&rdquo; in the hall, and sails upon
the lake; there were nine-pin alleys, and a gymnasium;
there were bathing parties, and horse-back parties; there
were billiard rooms, and smoking rooms; reading
rooms, flirtation rooms,&mdash;room for everything but&mdash;thought.</p>

<p>There could be little or nothing in such an artificial
atmosphere congenial with a nature like Ruth&rsquo;s. In all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
this motley crowd there was but one person who interested
her, a Mrs. Leon, upon whose queenly figure all
eyes were bent as she passed; and who received the
homage paid her, with an indifference which (whether
real or assumed) became her passing well. Her husband
was a tall, prim, proper-looking person, who dyed
his hair and whiskers every Saturday, was extremely
punctilious in all points of etiquette, very particular in
his stated inquiries as to his wife&rsquo;s and his horse&rsquo;s health,
very fastidious in regard to the brand of his wine, and
the quality of his venison; maintaining, under all circumstances,
the same rigidity of feature, the same immobility
of the cold, stony, gray eye, the same studied,
stereotyped, conventionalism of manner.</p>

<p>Ruth, although shunning society, found herself drawn
to Mrs. Leon by an unaccountable magnetism. Little
Katy, too, with that unerring instinct with which childhood
selects from the crowd an unselfish and loving nature,
had already made rapid advances toward acquaintance.
What road to a mother&rsquo;s heart so direct, as
through the heart of her children? With Katy for a
&ldquo;medium,&rdquo; the two ladies soon found themselves in frequent
conversation. Ruth had always shrunk from
female friendship. It might be that her boarding-school
experience had something to do in effecting this wholesale
disgust of the commodity. Be that as it may,
she had never found any woman who had not misunderstood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and misinterpreted her. For the common female
employments and recreations, she had an unqualified disgust.
Satin patchwork, the manufacture of German
worsted animals, bead-netting, crotchet-stitching, long
discussions with milliners, dress-makers, and modistes,
long forenoons spent in shopping, or leaving bits of
paste-board, party-giving, party-going, prinking and
coquetting, all these were her aversion. Equally with
herself, Mrs. Leon seemed to despise these air bubbles.
Ruth was sure that, under that faultless, marble exterior,
a glowing, living, loving heart lay slumbering; waiting
only the enchanter&rsquo;s touch to wake it into life. The
more she looked into those dark eyes, the deeper seemed
their depths. Ruth longed, she scarce knew why, to
make her life happy. Oh, if she <em>had</em> a soul!</p>

<p>Ruth thought of <em>Mr.</em> Leon and shuddered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leon was often subject to severe and prostrating
attacks of nervous headache. On these occasions, Ruth&rsquo;s
magnetic touch seemed to woo coy slumber, like a
spell; and the fair sufferer would lie peacefully for hours,
while Ruth&rsquo;s fingers strayed over her temples, or her
musical voice, like David&rsquo;s harp, exorcised the demon
Pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are better now,&rdquo; said Ruth, as Mrs. Leon slowly
opened her eyes, and looked about her; &ldquo;you have
had such a nice sleep, I think you will be able to join us
at the tea table to-night. I will brush these long dishevelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
locks, and robe these dainty limbs; though, to my
eye, you look lovelier just as you are. You are very
beautiful, Mary. I heard a couple of young ladies discussing
you, in the drawing-room, the other evening, envying
your beauty and your jewels, and the magnificence
of your wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they envy me my <em>husband</em>?&rdquo; asked Mary, in a
slow, measured tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would have been useless,&rdquo; said Ruth, averting
her eyes; &ldquo;but they said he denied you nothing in the
way of dress, equipage, or ornament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;I have all those pretty toys to
satisfy my heart-cravings; they, equally with myself, are
necessary appendages to Mr. Leon&rsquo;s establishment. Oh,
Ruth!&rdquo; and the tears streamed through her jewelled fingers&mdash;&ldquo;love
me&mdash;pity me; you who are so blessed. I
too <em>could</em> love; that is the drop of poison in my cup.
When <em>your</em> daughters stand at the altar, Ruth, never
compel them to say words to which the heart yields no
response. The chain is none the less galling, because its
links are golden. God bless you, Ruth; &rsquo;tis long since
I have shed such tears. You have touched the rock; forget
that the waters have gushed forth.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">October</span> had come! coy and chill in the morning,
warm and winning at noon, veiling her coat of many
colors in a fleecy mist at evening, yet lovely still in all
her changeful moods. The gay butterflies of fashion had
already spread their shrivelled wings for the warmer atmosphere
of the city. Harry and Ruth still lingered;&mdash;there
was beauty for them in the hill-side&rsquo;s rainbow dyes,
in the crimson barberry clusters, drooping from the wayside
hedges; in the wild grape-vine that threw off its
frost-bitten leaves, to tempt the rustic&rsquo;s hand with its
purple clusters; in the piles of apples, that lay gathered
in parti-colored heaps beneath the orchard trees; in the
yellow ears of Indian corn, that lay scattered on the seedy
floor of the breezy barn; in the festoons of dried apples,
and mammoth squashes, and pumpkins, that lay ripening
round the thrifty farmers&rsquo; doors; and in the circling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
leaves, that came eddying down in brilliant showers on
the Indian summer&rsquo;s soft but treacherous breath.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;You are ill, Harry,&rdquo; said Ruth, laying her hand upon
his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slightly so,&rdquo; replied Harry languidly; &ldquo;a pain in
my head, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strong ague chill prevented Harry from finishing the
sentence.</p>

<p>Ruth, who had never witnessed an attack of this kind,
grew pale as his teeth chattered, and his powerful frame
shook violently from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you suffered much in this way?&rdquo; asked the
physician who was summoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the fever and ague very badly, some years
since, at the west,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It is an unpleasant
visitor, doctor; you must rid me of it as soon as you
can, for the sake of my little wife, who, though she can endure
pain herself like a martyr, is an arrant little coward
whenever it attacks me. Don&rsquo;t look so sober, Ruth, I
shall be better to-morrow. I can not afford time to be sick
long, for I have a world of business on hand. I had an important
appointment this very day, which it is a thousand
pities to postpone; but never mind, I shall certainly
be better to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But Harry was not &ldquo;better to-morrow;&rdquo; nor the next
day; nor the next; the doctor pronouncing his case to
be one of decided typhus fever.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly the active man postponed his half-formed
plans, and business speculations, and allowed himself
to be placed on the sick list. With a sigh of impatience,
he saw his hat, and coat, and boots, put out of
sight; and watched the different phials, as they came in
from the apothecary; and counted the stroke of the
clock, as it told the tedious hours; and marvelled at the
patience with which (he now recollected) Ruth bore a
long bed-ridden eight-weeks&rsquo; martyrdom, without a groan
or complaint. But soon, other thoughts and images
mixed confusedly in his brain, like the shifting colors
of a kaleidoscope. He was floating&mdash;drifting&mdash;sinking&mdash;soaring,
by turns;&mdash;the hot blood coursed through his
veins like molten lava; his eye glared deliriously, and
the hand, never raised but in blessing, fell, with fevered
strength, upon the unresisting form of the loving wife.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have a nurse,&rdquo; said the doctor to Ruth;
&ldquo;it is dangerous for you to watch with your husband
alone. He might injure you seriously, in one of these
paroxysms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Harry has an unconquerable dislike to a hired
nurse,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;his reason may return at any moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and the sight of one will trouble him. I am not
afraid,&rdquo; replied Ruth, between a tear and a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will wear yourself out; you must remember
that you owe a duty to your children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>husband</em> has the <em>first</em> claim,&rdquo; said Ruth, resuming
her place by the bed-side; and during the long hours
of day and night, regardless of the lapse of time&mdash;regardless
of hunger, thirst or weariness, she glided noiselessly
about the room, arranged the pillows, mixed the
healing draught, or watched with a silent prayer at the
sufferer&rsquo;s bed-side; while Harry lay tossing from side to
side, his white teeth glittering through his unshorn beard,
raving constantly of her prolonged absence, and imploring
her in heart-rending tones to come to his side, and
&ldquo;bring Daisy from the Glen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many a friendly voice whispered at the door, &ldquo;How
is he?&rdquo; The Irish waiters crossed themselves and
stept softly through the hall, as they went on their
hasty errands; and many a consultation was held among
warm-hearted gentlemen friends, (who had made Harry&rsquo;s
acquaintance at the hotel, during the pleasant summer,)
to decide which should first prove their friendship by
watching with him.</p>

<p>Ruth declined all these offers to fill her place. &ldquo;I will
never leave him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;his reason may return, and
his eye seek vainly for me. No&mdash;no; I thank you all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Watch <em>with</em> me, if you will, but do not ask me to leave
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the still midnight, when the lids of the kind but
weary watchers drooped heavily with slumber, rang
mournfully in Ruth&rsquo;s ear the sad-plaint of Gethsemane&rsquo;s
Lord, &ldquo;Could ye not watch with me one hour?&rdquo; and
pressing her lips to the hot and fevered hand before her,
she murmured, &ldquo;I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Have</span> you got the carpet-bag, doctor? and the little
brown bundle? and the russet-trunk? and the umberil?
and the demi-john, and the red band-box, with my
best cap in it? one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four; yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
right. Now, mind those thievish porters. Goodness,
how they charge here for carriage hire! I never knew,
before, how much money it took to journey. Oh dear!
I wonder if Harry <em>is</em> worse? There now, doctor,
you&rsquo;ve put your foot right straight through that band-box.
Now, where, for the land&rsquo;s sake, are my spectacles?
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t possible you&rsquo;ve left them behind? I put
them in the case, as you stood there in the chayna closet,
drinking your brandy and water, and asked you to put
them in your side-pocket, because my bag was full of
orange-peels, scissors, camphor, peppermint-drops, and
seed-cakes. I wouldn&rsquo;t have left &rsquo;em for any money.
Such a sight of trouble as it was to get them focussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
right to my eyes. How <em>could</em> you, doctor, be so blundering?
I declare it is enough to provoke a saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, there&rsquo;s no immediate call for <em>you</em>
to get vexed,&rdquo; said the doctor, tartly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the house?&rdquo; asked the old lady, her curiosity
getting the better of her indignation; &ldquo;what a big hotel!
I wonder if Harry <em>is</em> worse? Mercy me, I&rsquo;m all of a
quiver. I wonder if they will take us right into the
drawing-room? I wonder if there&rsquo;s many ladies in it&mdash;my
bonnet is awfully jammed: beside, I&rsquo;m so powdered
with dust, that I look as if I had had an ash barrel sifted
over me. Doctor! doctor! don&rsquo;t go on so far ahead.
It looks awk&rsquo;ard, as if I had no protector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo; said the doctor, to a white-jacketted
waiter, who stood gossipping on the piazza steps
with a comrade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny old chap!&rdquo; said the waiter, without noticing
the doctor&rsquo;s query; &ldquo;I say, Bill, look how his hair is
cut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint hair,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it is a wig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my eyes! so it is; and a red one, too! Bad
symptoms; red wigs are the cheapest; no extra fees to
be got out of <em>that</em> customer, for blacking boots and
bringing hot beafsteaks. Besides, just look at his baggage;
you can always judge of a traveler, Bill, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
trunks; it never fails. Now, <em>I</em> like to see a trunk
thickly studded with brass nails, and covered with a
linen overall; then I know, if it is a lady&rsquo;s, that there&rsquo;s
diamond rings inside, and plenty of cash; if &rsquo;tis a gentleman&rsquo;s,
that he knows how to order sherry-cobblers
in the forenoon, and a bottle of old wine or two with his
dinner; and how to fee the poor fellow who brings it,
too, who lives on a small salary, with large expectations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo; thundered the doctor again, (after
waiting what he considered a reasonable time for an answer,)
&ldquo;or if <em>you</em> are too lazy to tell, you whiskered
jackanapes, go call your employer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; recalled the rambling waiter to
his senses, and great was his consternation on finding that
&ldquo;the old chap with the red wig&rdquo; was the father of young
Mr. Hall, who was beloved by everything in the establishment,
down to old Neptune the house-dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said the doctor, turning to his wife;
&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s no better&mdash;consultation this morning&mdash;very
little hope of him;&mdash;so much for <em>my</em> not being here to
prescribe for him. Ruth shouldered a great responsibility
when she brought him away out of reach of <em>my</em> practice.
You go into that room, there, Mis. Hall, No. 20, with
your traps and things, and take off your bonnet and keep
quiet, while I go up and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Humph!</span>&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;humph!&rdquo; as Ruth drew
aside the curtain, and the light fell full upon Harry&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Humph! it is all up with <em>him</em>; he&rsquo;s in the last
stage of the complaint; won&rsquo;t live two days;&rdquo; and stepping
to the table, the doctor uncorked the different phials,
applied them to the end of his nose, examined the labels,
and then returned to the bed-side, where Ruth stood
bending over Harry, so pallid, so tearless, that one involuntarily
prayed that death, when he aimed his dart,
might strike down both together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the doctor again! &ldquo;when did he have
his reason last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few moments, day before yesterday,&rdquo; said Ruth,
without removing her eyes from Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; he has been <em>murdered</em>,&mdash;yes murdered, just
as much as if you had seen the knife put to his throat.
That tells the whole story, and I don&rsquo;t care who knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
it. I have been looking at those phials,&mdash;wrong course
of treatment altogether for typhoid fever; fatal mistake.
His death will lie heavy at <em>somebody&rsquo;s</em> door,&rdquo; and he
glanced at Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! he is coming to himself,&rdquo; said Ruth, whose
eyes had never once moved from her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must tell him that his hours are numbered,&rdquo;
said the doctor, thrusting his hands in his pockets, and
pompously walking round the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; whispered Ruth, grasping his arm with both
hands; &ldquo;you will kill him. The doctor said it might
destroy the last chance for his life. <em>Don&rsquo;t</em> tell him. You
know he is not afraid <em>to die</em>; but oh, spare him the parting
with me! it will be so hard; he loves me, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the doctor, shaking her off; &ldquo;he ought
to settle up his affairs while he can. I don&rsquo;t know how
he wants things fixed. Harry! Harry!&rdquo; said he, touching
his shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see you; do you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Harry, languidly, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sick. I shall be better soon; don&rsquo;t worry about me.
Where&rsquo;s my wife? where&rsquo;s Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> be better, Harry,&rdquo; said the doctor,
bluntly, stepping between him and Ruth; &ldquo;you may
not live the day out. If you have got anything to say,
you&rsquo;d better say it now, before your mind wanders.
You are a dead man, Harry; and you know that when
I say <em>that</em>, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick man gazed at the speaker, as if he were in a
dream; then slowly, and with a great effort, raising
his head, he looked about the room for Ruth. She was
kneeling at the bedside, with her face buried in her
hands. Harry reached out his emaciated hand, and
placed it upon her bowed head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth? wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her arm was about his neck in an instant&mdash;her lips to
his; but her eyes were tearless, and her whole frame
shook convulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how <em>can</em> I leave you? who will care for you?
Oh God, in mercy spare me to her;&rdquo; and Harry fell
back on his pillow.</p>

<p>The shock was too sudden; reason again wandered;
he heard the shrill whistle of the cars, recalling him to
the city&rsquo;s whirl of business; he had stocks to negotiate;
he had notes to pay; he had dividends due. Then the
scene changed;&mdash;he could not be carried on a hearse
through the street, surrounded by a gaping crowd.
Ruth must go alone with him, by night;&mdash;why <em>must</em> he
die at all? He would take anything. Where was the
doctor? Why did they waste time in talking? Why
not do something more for him? How cruel of Ruth to
let him lie there and die?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try this new remedy,&rdquo; said one of the consulting
physicians to Harry&rsquo;s father; &ldquo;it is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thing that remains to be done, and I confess I have no
faith in its efficacy in this case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He rallies again!&rdquo; said Ruth, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children!&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;bring me the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said the new physician; &ldquo;try and swallow
this first;&rdquo; and he raised his head tenderly.</p>

<p>They were brought him. Little Nettie came first,&mdash;her
dimpled arms and rosy face in strange contrast to
the pallid lips she bent, in childish glee, to kiss. Then
little Katy, shrinking with a strange awe from the dear
papa she loved so much, and sobbing, she scarce knew
why, at his whispered words, &ldquo;Be kind to your mother,
Katy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Harry&rsquo;s eyes sought Ruth. She was there, but
a film&mdash;a mist had come between them; he could not
see her, though he felt her warm breath.</p>

<p>And now, that powerful frame collected all its remaining
energies for the last dread contest with death. So
fearful&mdash;so terrible was the struggle, that friends stood
by, with suppressed breath and averted eyes, while Ruth
alone, with a fearful calmness, hour after hour, wiped the
death damp from his brow, and the oozing foam from
his pallid lips.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said the old doctor, laying Harry&rsquo;s
hand down upon the coverlid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he breathes again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah; that&rsquo;s his last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take her away,&rdquo; said the doctor, as Ruth fell heavily
across her husband&rsquo;s body; and the unresisting form of
the insensible wife was borne into the next room.</p>

<p>Strange hands closed Harry&rsquo;s eyes, parted his damp
locks, straightened his manly limbs, and folded the marble
hands over as noble a heart as ever lay cold and still
beneath a shroud.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;It</span> is really quite dreadful to see her in this way,&rdquo;
said Hyacinth, as they chafed Ruth&rsquo;s hands and
bathed her temples; &ldquo;it is really quite dreadful. Somebody
ought to tell her, when she comes to, that her hair is
parted unevenly and needs brushing sadly. Harry&rsquo;s finely-chiseled
features look quite beautiful in repose. It is a
pity the barber should have been allowed to shave off his
beard after death; it looked quite oriental and picturesque.
But the sight of Ruth, in this way, is really
dreadful; it quite unnerves me. I shall look ten years
older by to-morrow. I must go down and take a turn or
two on the piazza.&rdquo; And Hyacinth paced up and down,
thinking&mdash;not of the bereaved sister, who lay mercifully
insensible to her loss, nor yet of the young girl whose
heart was to throb trustfully at the altar, by his side, on
the morrow,&mdash;but of her broad lands and full coffers,
with which he intended to keep at bay the haunting creditors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who were impertinent enough to spoil his daily
digestion by asking for their just dues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One o&rsquo;clock! The effect of the sleeping potion administered
to Ruth had passed away. Slowly she unclosed
her eyes and gazed about her. The weary nurse, forgetful
of her charge, had sunk into heavy slumber.</p>

<p>Where was Harry?</p>

<p>Ruth presses her hands to her temples. Oh God! the
consciousness that <em>would</em> come! the frantic out-reaching
of the arms to clasp&mdash;a vain shadow!</p>

<p>Where had they lain him?</p>

<p>She crossed the hall to Harry&rsquo;s sick room; the key
was in the lock; she turned it with trembling fingers.
Oh God! the dreadful stillness of that outlined form!
the calm majesty of that marble brow, on which the
moonbeams fell as sweetly as if that peaceful sleep was
but to restore him to her widowed arms. That half
filled glass, from which his dying lips had turned away;&mdash;those
useless phials;&mdash;that watch&mdash;<em>his</em> watch&mdash;moving&mdash;and
<em>he</em> so still!&mdash;the utter helplessness of human aid;&mdash;the
dreadful might of Omnipotence!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, when was he ever deaf before to the music of that
voice? Oh, how could Ruth (God forgive her!) look
upon those dumb lips and say, &ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; muttered Hyacinth, as the undertaker
passed him on the stairs with Harry&rsquo;s coffin. &ldquo;These
business details are very shocking to a sensitive person.
I beg your pardon; did you address me?&rdquo; said he, to a
gentleman who raised his hat as he passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished to do so, though an entire stranger to you,&rdquo;
said the gentleman, with a sympathizing glance, which
was quite thrown away on Hyacinth. &ldquo;I have had the
pleasure of living under the same roof, this summer, with
your afflicted sister and her noble husband, and have become
warmly attached to both. In common with several
warm friends of your brother-in-law, I am pained to learn
that, owing to the failure of parties for whom he had become
responsible, there will be little or nothing for the
widow and her children, when his affairs are settled. It is
our wish to make up a purse, and request her acceptance
of it, through you, as a slight token of the estimation in
which we held her husband&rsquo;s many virtues. I understand
you are to leave before the funeral, which must be
my apology for intruding upon you at so unseasonable
an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the courtliest of bows, in the blandest of tones,
Hyacinth assured, while he thanked Mr. Kendall, that
himself, his father, and, indeed, all the members of the
family, were abundantly able, and most solicitous, to supply
every want, and anticipate every wish of Ruth and
her children; and that it was quite impossible she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ever suffer for anything, or be obliged in any way, at any
future time, to exert herself for her own, or their support;
all of which good news for Ruth highly gratified
Mr. Kendall, who grasped the velvet palm of Hyacinth,
and dashed away a grateful tear, that the promise to the
widow and fatherless was remembered in heaven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;They</span> are very attentive to us here,&rdquo; remarked the
doctor, as one after another of Harry&rsquo;s personal
friends paid their respects, for his sake, to the old couple
at No. 20. &ldquo;Very attentive, and yet, Mis. Hall, I only
practiced physic in this town six months, five years ago.
It is really astonishing how long a good physician will be
remembered,&rdquo; and the doctor crossed his legs comfortably,
and tapped on his snuff-box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth&rsquo;s brother, Hyacinth, leaves before the funeral,
doctor,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;I suppose you see through
<em>that</em>. He intends to be off and out of the way, before
the time comes to decide where Ruth shall put her head,
after Harry is buried; and there&rsquo;s her father, just like
him; he has been as uneasy as an eel in a frying-pan,
ever since he came, and this morning <em>he</em> went off, without
asking a question about Harry&rsquo;s affairs. I suppose he
thinks it is <em>our</em> business, and he owning bank stock. I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
you, doctor, that Ruth may go a-begging, for all the
help she&rsquo;ll get from <em>her</em> folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or from me, either,&rdquo; said the doctor, thrusting his
thumbs into the arm-holes of his vest, and striding across
the room. &ldquo;She has been a spoiled baby long enough;
she will find earning her living a different thing from sitting
with her hands folded, with Harry chained to her
feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do with that bottle of old wine, Mis.
Hall, which I told you to bring out of Harry&rsquo;s room?
He never drank but one glass of it, after that gentleman
sent it to him, and we might as well have it as to let
those lazy waiters drink it up. There were two or three
bunches of grapes, too, he didn&rsquo;t eat; you had better
take them, too, while you are about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t seem, after all, as if Harry was dead,&rdquo;
said the doctor, musingly; &ldquo;but the Lord&rsquo;s will be
done. Here comes your dress-maker, Mis. Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, ma&rsquo;am, good afternoon, sir,&rdquo; said
Miss Skinlin, with a doleful whine, drawing down
the corners of her mouth and eyes to suit the occasion.
&ldquo;Sad affliction you&rsquo;ve met with. As our minister says,
&lsquo;man is like the herb of the field; blooming to-day,
withered to-morrow.&rsquo; Life is short: will you have your
dress gathered or biased, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite immaterial,&rdquo; said the old lady, anxious to appear
indifferent; &ldquo;though you may as well, I suppose,
do it the way which is worn the most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, some likes it one way, and then again, some
likes it another. The doctor&rsquo;s wife in the big, white
house yonder&mdash;do you know the doctor&rsquo;s wife, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice folks, ma&rsquo;am; open-handed; never mind my giving
&rsquo;em back the change, when they pay me. <em>She</em> was a
Skefflit. Do you know the Skefflits? Possible? why
they are our first folks. Well, la, where was I? Oh! the
doctor&rsquo;s wife has <em>her</em> gowns biased; but then she&rsquo;s getting
fat, and wants to look slender. I&rsquo;d advise you to have
yourn gathered. Dreadful affliction you&rsquo;ve met with,
ma&rsquo;am. Beautiful corpse your son is. I always look at
corpses to remind me of my latter end. Some corpses
keep much longer than others; don&rsquo;t you think so,
ma&rsquo;am? They tell me your son&rsquo;s wife is most crazy,
because they doted on one another so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor and his wife exchanged meaning looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Do tell?</em>&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin, dropping her shears.
&ldquo;Well, I never! &lsquo;How desaitful the heart is,&rsquo; as our
minister says. Why, everybody about here took &rsquo;em
for regular turtle-doves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All is not gold that glitters,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked the old lady.
&ldquo;There is many a heart-ache that nobody knows anything
about, but He who made the heart. In my opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
our son was not anxious to continue in this world of
trial longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin. &ldquo;Pious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Certainly</em>,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Was he not <em>our</em> son?
Though, since his marriage, his wife&rsquo;s influence was very
worldly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; whined Miss Skinlin; &ldquo;professors should let
their light shine. <em>I</em> always try to drop a word in season,
wherever business calls <em>me</em>. Will you have a cross-way
fold on your sleeve, ma&rsquo;am? I don&rsquo;t think it would be
out of place, even on this mournful occasion. Mrs. Tufts
wore one when her eldest child died, and she was dreadful
grief-stricken. I remember she gave me (poor dear!)
a five-dollar note, instead of a two; but that was a thing
I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to harass her about at such a time. I
respected her grief too much, ma&rsquo;am. Did I understand
you that I was to put the cross-way folds on your sleeve,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may do as you like,&rdquo; whined the old lady;
&ldquo;people <em>do</em> dress more at hotels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin; &ldquo;and I often feel reproved for
aiding and abetting such foolish vanities; and yet, if I refused,
from conscientious scruples, to trim dresses, I suppose
somebody else <em>would</em>; so you see, it wouldn&rsquo;t do
any good. Your daughter-in-law is left rich, I suppose.
I always think that&rsquo;s a great consolation to a bereaved
widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t <em>suppose</em> any such thing,&rdquo; said the doctor,
facing Miss Skinlin; &ldquo;she hasn&rsquo;t the first red cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreadful!&rdquo; shrieked Miss Skinlin. &ldquo;What <em>is</em> she
going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That tells the whole story,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;sure
enough, what <em>is</em> she going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;ll live with <em>you</em>,&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin,
suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t suppose <em>that</em>, either,&rdquo; retorted the doctor.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t every person, Miss Skinlin, who is agreeable
enough to be taken into one&rsquo;s house; besides, she
has got folks of her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;ah!&rdquo;&mdash;said Miss Skinlin; &ldquo;rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;unless some of their
poor relatives turn up, in which case, they are always
dreadfully out of pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I un-der-stand,&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin, with a significant
nod. &ldquo;Well; I don&rsquo;t see anything left for her to do,
but to earn her living, like some other folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Precisely">P-r-e-c-i-s-e-l-y</strong>,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah,&rdquo;&mdash;said Miss Skinlin, who had at last possessed
herself of &ldquo;the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to ask you how wide a hem I should allow on
your black crape veil,&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin, tying on her
bonnet to go. &ldquo;Half a yard width is not considered too
much for the <em>deepest</em> affliction. Your daughter, the widow,
will probably have that width,&rdquo; said the crafty dress-maker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, Ruth is in no deeper affliction than
we are,&rdquo; said the doctor, growing very red in the face;
&ldquo;although she makes more fuss about it; so you may
just make the hem of Mis. Hall&rsquo;s veil half-yard deep too,
and send the bill into No. 20, where it will be footed
by Doctor Zekiel Hall, who is not in the habit of ordering
what he can&rsquo;t pay for. <em>That</em> tells the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Miss Skinlin, with another
doleful whine. &ldquo;May the Lord be your support, and let
the light of His countenance shine upon you, as our minister
says.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Slowly</span> the funeral procession wound along. The
gray-haired gate-keeper of the cemetery stepped aside,
and gazed into the first carriage as it passed in. He saw
only a pale woman veiled in sable, and two little wondering,
rosy faces gazing curiously out the carriage window.
All about, on either side, were graves; some
freshly sodded, others green with many a summer&rsquo;s verdure,
and all treasuring sacred ashes, while the mourners
went about the streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dust to dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry&rsquo;s coffin was lifted from the hearse, and laid upon
the green sward by the side of little Daisy. Over him
waved leafy trees, of his own planting; while through the
branches the shifting shadows came and went, lending a
mocking glow to the dead man&rsquo;s face. Little Katy came
forward, and gazed into the yawning grave till her golden
curls fell like a veil over her wondering eyes. Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
leaned upon the arm of her cousin, a dry, flinty, ossified
man of business; a man of angles&mdash;a man of forms&mdash;a
man with veins of ice, who looked the Almighty in the
face complacently, &ldquo;thanking God he was not as other
men are;&rdquo; who gazed with stony eyes upon the open
grave, and the orphan babes, and the bowed form at his
side, which swayed to and fro like the young tree before
the tempest blast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dust to dust!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth shrinks trembling back, then leans eagerly forward;
now she takes the last lingering look at features
graven on her memory with lines of fire; and now, as the
earth falls with a hard, hollow sound upon the coffin, a
lightning thought comes with stunning force to little
Katy, and she sobs out, &ldquo;Oh, they are covering my papa
up; I can&rsquo;t ever see papa any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dust to dust!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sexton smooths the moist earth carefully with his
reversed spade; Ruth&rsquo;s eyes follow his movements with
a strange fascination. Now the carriages roll away one
after another, and the wooden man turns to Ruth and
says, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; She looks into his stony face, then at the
new-made mound, utters a low, stifled cry, and staggers
forth with her crushing sorrow.</p>

<p>Oh, Earth! Earth! with thy mocking skies of blue,
thy placid silver streams, thy myriad, memory-haunting
odorous flowers, thy wheels of triumph rolling&mdash;rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on, over breaking hearts and prostrate forms&mdash;maimed,
tortured, crushed, yet not destroyed. Oh,
mocking Earth! snatching from our frenzied grasp the
life-long coveted treasure! Most treacherous Earth! are
these thy unkept promises?</p>

<p>Oh, hadst thou no Gethsemane&mdash;no Calvary&mdash;no guarded
tomb&mdash;no risen Lord!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;And</span> is it because Biddy M&rsquo;Pherson don&rsquo;t suit yer,
that ye&rsquo;d be afther sending her away?&rdquo; said Ruth&rsquo;s
nursery maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Biddy,&rdquo; replied Ruth; &ldquo;you have been respectful
to me, and kind and faithful to the children, but I cannot
afford to keep you now since&mdash;&rdquo; and Ruth&rsquo;s voice
faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is all, my leddy,&rdquo; said Biddy, brightening up,
&ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll not be afther laving, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, quite moved by her devotion;
&ldquo;but you must not work for me without wages.
Besides, Biddy, I could not even pay your board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the tears not dry on your cheek; and the father
of him and you with plenty of the siller. May the divil
fly away wid &rsquo;em! Why, Nettie is but a babby yet,
and Masther used to say you must walk every day, to
keep off the bad headaches; and it&rsquo;s coming could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
weather, and you can&rsquo;t take Nettie out, and you can&rsquo;t
lave her with Katy; and anyhow it isn&rsquo;t Biddy
M&rsquo;Pherson that&rsquo;ll be going away intirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The allusion to Harry&rsquo;s tender care of Ruth&rsquo;s health
opened the wound afresh, and she wept convulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; said Biddy, becoming more excited
at the sight of her tears; &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t do it, my
leddy; you are as white as a sheet of paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em>,&rdquo; said Ruth, controlling herself with a violent
effort; &ldquo;say no more, Biddy. I don&rsquo;t know where I am
going; but wherever it may be I shall always be glad to
see you. Katy and Nettie shall not forget their kind
nurse; now, go and pack your trunk,&rdquo; said Ruth, assuming
a composure she was far from feeling. &ldquo;I thank you
for your kind offer, though I cannot accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the sowls of &rsquo;em niver get out of purgatory;
that&rsquo;s Biddy&rsquo;s last word to &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the impetuous Irish
girl; &ldquo;and if the priest himself should say that St. Peter
wouldn&rsquo;t open the gate for your leddyship, I wouldn&rsquo;t
believe him.&rdquo; And unclasping little Nettie&rsquo;s clinging
arms from her neck, and giving a hurried kiss to little
Katy, Biddy went sobbing through the door, with her
check apron over her broad Irish face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s</span> that coming up the garden-walk, doctor?&rdquo;
said the old lady; &ldquo;Ruth&rsquo;s father, as true as the
world. Ah! I understand, we shall see what we shall
see; mind you keep a stiff upper lip, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine place you have here, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just come from a visit to Ruth,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ellet.</p>

<p>The imperturbable doctor slightly nodded to his visitor,
as he took a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to take her husband&rsquo;s death very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ellet, fidgeting in
his chair, &ldquo;that there is nothing left for the support of
the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the world will talk about us, if nothing is
done for her,&rdquo; said the non-committal Mr. Ellet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry was <em>your</em> child,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth is yours,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet; &ldquo;but you are better
off than I am, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deny it&mdash;I deny it,&rdquo; retorted the doctor, fairly
roused; &ldquo;you own the house you live in, and have a
handsome income, or <em>ought</em> to have,&rdquo; said he, sneeringly,
&ldquo;at the rate you live. If you have brought up your
daughter in extravagance, so much the worse for <em>her</em>;
you and Ruth must settle that between you. I wash <em>my</em>
hands of her. I have no objection to take Harry&rsquo;s <em>children</em>,
and try to bring them up in a sensible manner; but,
in that case, I&rsquo;ll have none of the mother&rsquo;s interference.
Then her hands will be free to earn her own living, and
she&rsquo;s none too good for it, either. I don&rsquo;t believe in your
doll-baby women; she&rsquo;s proud, you are all proud, all
your family&mdash;that tells the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was rather plain Saxon, as the increased redness
of Mr. Ellet&rsquo;s ears testified; but pecuniary considerations
helped him to swallow the bitter pill without
making a wry face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Ruth could be induced to part with
her children,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, meditatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her try to support them then, till she gets
starved out,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;I suppose you know,
if the mother&rsquo;s inability to maintain them is proved,
the law obliges each of the grand-parents to take one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a new view of the case, and one which immediately
put to flight any reluctance Mr. Ellet might
have had to force Ruth to part with her children; and
remarking that he thought upon reflection, that the children
<em>would</em> be better off with the doctor, Mr. Ellet took
his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that stroke would tell,&rdquo; said the doctor,
laughing, as Mr. Ellet closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you hit the right nail on the head that time,&rdquo;
remarked the old lady; &ldquo;but those children will be a
sight of trouble. They never sat still five minutes at a
time, since they were born; but I&rsquo;ll soon cure them of
that. I&rsquo;m determined Ruth shan&rsquo;t have them, if they
fret me to fiddling-strings; but what an avaricious old
man Mr. Ellet is. We ought to be thankful we have
more of the gospel spirit. But the clock has struck nine,
doctor. It is time to have prayers, and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> day was dark and gloomy. Incessant weeping
and fasting had brought on one of Ruth&rsquo;s most violent
attacks of nervous headache. Ah! where was the
hand which had so lately charmed that pain away?
where was the form that, with uplifted finger and tiptoe
tread, hushed the slightest sound, excluded the torturing
light, changed the heated pillow, and bathed the aching
temples? Poor Ruth! nature had been tasked its utmost
with sad memories and weary vigils, and she sank
fainting to the floor.</p>

<p>Well might the frightened children huddle breathless
in the farther corner. The coffin, the shroud, and the
grave, were all too fresh in their childish memory.
Well might the tearful prayer go up to the only Friend
they knew,&mdash;&ldquo;Please God, don&rsquo;t take away our mamma,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth heard it not; well had she <em>never</em> woke, but the
bitter cup was not yet drained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Ruth,&rdquo; said her father, (a few hours
after,) frowning slightly as Ruth&rsquo;s pale face, and the
swollen eyes of her children, met his view. &ldquo;Sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of my bad headaches,&rdquo; replied Ruth, with a
quivering lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that comes of excitement; you shouldn&rsquo;t get
excited. I never allow myself to worry about what
can&rsquo;t be helped; this is the hand of God, and you ought
to see it. I came to bring you good news. The doctor
has very generously offered to take both your children
and support them. It will be a great burden off your
hands; all he asks in return is, that he shall have the
entire control of them, and that you keep away. It is a
great thing, Ruth, and what I didn&rsquo;t expect of the doctor,
knowing his avaricious habits. Now you&rsquo;ll have
something pleasant to think about, getting their things
ready to go; the sooner you do it the better. How
soon, think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can <em>never</em> part with my children,&rdquo; replied Ruth, in
a voice which, though low, was perfectly clear and distinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect madness,&rdquo; said her father, rising and pacing
the floor; &ldquo;they will have a good home, enough to eat,
drink, and wear, and be taught&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To disrespect their mother,&rdquo; said Ruth, in the same
clear, low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said her father impatiently; &ldquo;do you mean
to let such a trifle as that stand in the way of their bread
and butter? I&rsquo;m poor, Ruth, or at least I <em>may</em> be to-morrow,
who knows? so you must not depend on me; I
want you to consider that, before you refuse. Perhaps
you expect to support them yourself; you can&rsquo;t do it,
that&rsquo;s clear, and if you should refuse the doctor&rsquo;s offer,
and then die and leave them, he wouldn&rsquo;t take them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their <em>Father in Heaven</em> will,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;He says,
&lsquo;Leave thy fatherless children with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perversion of Scripture, perversion of Scripture,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ellet, foiled with his own weapons.</p>

<p>Ruth replied only with her tears, and a kiss on each
little head, which had nestled up to her with an indistinct
idea that she needed sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use getting up a scene, it won&rsquo;t move me,
Ruth,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, irritated by the sight of the weeping
group before him, and the faint twinges of his own
conscience; &ldquo;the doctor <em>must</em> take the children, there&rsquo;s
nothing else left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Ruth, rising from her couch and standing
before him; &ldquo;my children are all I have left to love;
in pity do not distress me by urging what I can never
grant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you make your bed, so lie in it,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
buttoning up his coat, and turning his back upon his
daughter.</p>

<p>It was a sight to move the stoutest heart to see Ruth
that night, kneeling by the side of those sleeping children,
with upturned eyes, and clasped hands of entreaty,
and lips from which no sound issued, though her
heart was quivering with agony; and yet a pitying Eye
looked down upon those orphaned sleepers, a pitying Ear
bent low to list to the widow&rsquo;s voiceless prayer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, Mis. Hall, you have got your answer. Ruth
won&rsquo;t part with the children,&rdquo; said the doctor, as
he refolded Mr. Ellet&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you have lived with me forty years, come
last January, haven&rsquo;t you, doctor?&rdquo; said his amiable
spouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of that? I don&rsquo;t see where that remark is
going to fetch up, Mis. Hall,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You
are not as young as you might be, to be sure, but I&rsquo;m no
boy myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again, off the track. I didn&rsquo;t make
any allusion to my age. It&rsquo;s a thing I <em>never</em> do. It&rsquo;s a
thing I never wish <em>you</em> to do. I repeat, that I have lived
with you these forty years; well, did you ever know me
back out of anything I undertook? Did you ever see
me foiled? That letter makes no difference with me;
Harry&rsquo;s children I&rsquo;m determined to have, sooner or later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
What can&rsquo;t be had by force, must be had by stratagem.
I propose, therefore, a compromise, (<abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="pro tempore">pro-tem.</abbr>) You and
Mr. Ellet had better agree to furnish a certain sum for
awhile, for the support of Ruth and her children, giving
her to understand that it is discretionary, and may stop
at any minute. That will conciliate Ruth, and will <em>look</em>
better, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Miss Taffety told me yesterday that she
heard some hard talking about us down in the village,
between Mrs. Rice and Deacon Gray (whose child Ruth
watched so many nights with, when it had the scarlet
fever). Yes, it will have a better look, doctor, and we
can withdraw the allowance whenever the &lsquo;nine days&rsquo;
wonder&rsquo; is over. These people have something else to
do than to keep track of poor widows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never supposed a useless, fine lady, like Ruth,
would rather work to support her children than to give
them up; but I don&rsquo;t give her any credit for it now, for
I&rsquo;m quite sure it&rsquo;s all sheer obstinacy, and only to spite
us,&rdquo; continued the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; and the old lady cocked her head on one
side, and crossed her two forefingers, &ldquo;whenever&mdash;you&mdash;see&mdash;a&mdash;blue-eyed&mdash;soft-voiced&mdash;gentle&mdash;woman,&mdash;look&mdash;out&mdash;for&mdash;a&mdash;hurricane.
I tell you that placid Ruth is
a smouldering volcano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That tells the whole story,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And
speaking of volcanoes, it won&rsquo;t be so easy to make Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Ellet subscribe anything for Ruth&rsquo;s support; he thinks
more of one cent than of any child he ever had. I am
expecting him every moment, Mis. Hall, to talk over our
proposal about Ruth. Perhaps you had better leave us
alone; you know you have a kind of irritating way if anything
comes across you, and you might upset the whole
business. As to my paying anything towards Ruth&rsquo;s
board unless he does his full share, you needn&rsquo;t fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not; well, I&rsquo;ll leave you,&rdquo; said the old
lady, with a sly glance at the china closet, &ldquo;though I
doubt if <em>you</em> understand managing him alone. Now I
could wind him round my little finger in five minutes if
I chose, but I hate to stoop to it, I so detest the whole
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake hands with you there,&rdquo; said the doctor;
&ldquo;but that puppy of a Hyacinth is my <em>especial</em> aversion,
though Ruth is bad enough in her way; a mincing, conceited,
tip-toeing, be-curled, be-perfumed popinjay&mdash;faugh!
Do you suppose, Mis. Hall, there <em>can</em> be anything
in a man who wears fancy neck-ties, a seal ring on
his little finger, and changes his coat and vest a dozen
times a day? No; he&rsquo;s a sensuous fop, that tells the
whole story; ought to be picked up with a pair of sugar-tongs,
and laid carefully on a rose-leaf. Ineffable
puppy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They made a great fuss about his writings,&rdquo; said the
old lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who</em> made a fuss? Fudge&mdash;there&rsquo;s that piece of his
about &lsquo;The Saviour&rsquo;; he describes him as he would a
Broadway dandy. That fellow is all surface, I tell you;
there&rsquo;s no depth in him. How should there be? Isn&rsquo;t
he an Ellet? but look, here comes his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, doctor. My time is rather limited this
morning,&rdquo; said Ruth&rsquo;s father nervously; &ldquo;was it of
Ruth you wished to speak to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;she seems to feel so badly
about letting the children go, that it quite touched my
feelings, and I thought of allowing her something for
awhile, towards their support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very generous of you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, infinitely relieved;
&ldquo;very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;I heard yesterday that
Deacon Gray and Mrs. Rice, two very influential church
members, were talking hard of you and me about this matter;
yes, as you remarked, Mr. Ellet, I <em>am</em> generous, and
I am <em>willing</em> to give Ruth a small sum, for an unspecified
time, provided you will give her the same amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Me?</em>&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet; &ldquo;<em>me?</em>&mdash;I am a poor man, doctor;
shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised any day, if I had to mortgage
the house I live in: you wouldn&rsquo;t have me die in
the almshouse, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; and I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t be willing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Ruth should?&rdquo; said the doctor, who could take her part
when it suited him to carry a point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money is tight, money is tight,&rdquo; said old Mr. Ellet,
frowning; &ldquo;when a man marries his children, they ought
to be considered off his hands. I don&rsquo;t know why I
should be called upon. Ruth went out of my family,
and went into yours, and there she was when her trouble
came. Money is tight, though, of course, <em>you</em> don&rsquo;t feel
it, doctor, living here on your income with your hands
folded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; retorted the doctor, getting vexed in his
turn; &ldquo;that all sounds very well; but the question is,
what <em>is</em> my &lsquo;income&rsquo;? Beside, when a man has earned
his money by riding six miles of a cold night, to pull a
tooth for twenty-five cents, he don&rsquo;t feel like throwing it
away on other folks&rsquo; children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are not those children as much your grand-children
as they are mine?&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, sharply, as he peered
over his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking
an Æsculapian view of the case; &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t think
they were&mdash;blue eyes&mdash;sanguine temperament, like their
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;not much Hall blood in &rsquo;em I fancy; more&rsquo;s
the pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use being uncivil,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, reddening.
&ldquo;<em>I</em> never am uncivil. I came here because I thought you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
had something to say; if you have not, I&rsquo;ll go; my time
is precious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not answered my question yet,&rdquo; said the
doctor; &ldquo;I asked you, if you would give the same that I
would to Ruth for a time, only a <em>short</em> time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Ellet,&rdquo; continued the doctor, forced to
fall back at last upon his reserved argument; &ldquo;we are
both church members; and the churches to which we belong
have a way (which I think is a wrong way, but that&rsquo;s
neither here nor there) of meddling in these little family
matters. It would not be very pleasant for you or me
to be catechised, or disciplined by a church committee;
and it&rsquo;s my advice to you to avoid such a disagreeable
alternative: they say hard things about us. We have a
Christian reputation to sustain, brother Ellet,&rdquo; and the
doctor grew pietistic and pathetic.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellet looked anxious. If there was anything he
particularly prided himself upon, it was his reputation for
devoted piety. Here was a desperate struggle&mdash;mammon
pulling one way, the church the other. The doctor saw
his advantage, and followed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Ellet, what will you give? here&rsquo;s a piece
of paper; put it down in black and white,&rdquo; said the vigilant
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never put anything on paper, never put anything on
paper,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, in a solemn tone, with a ludicrously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
frightened air; &ldquo;parchments, lawyers, witnesses,
and things, make me nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; chuckled the old lady from her hiding-place
in the china-closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you won&rsquo;t put it on paper, <em>tell</em> me what
you will give,&rdquo; said the persistent doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <em>think</em> about it,&rdquo; said the frenzied Mr. Ellet, seizing
his hat, as if instant escape were his only safety.</p>

<p>The doctor followed him into the hall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you make him do it?&rdquo; asked the old lady, in a
hoarse whisper, as the doctor entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it was like drawing teeth,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
&ldquo;It is astonishing how avaricious he is; he may not
stick to his promise now, for he would not put it on paper,
and there was no witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there though?&rdquo; said the old lady, chuckling.
&ldquo;Trust me for that.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> a dark, narrow street, in one of those heterogeneous
boarding-houses abounding in the city, where clerks,
market-boys, apprentices, and sewing-girls, bolt their
meals with railroad velocity; where the maid-of-all-work,
with red arms, frowzy head, and leathern lungs, screams
in the entry for any boarder who happens to be inquired
for at the door; where one plate suffices for fish, flesh,
fowl, and dessert; where soiled table-cloths, sticky crockery,
oily cookery, and bad grammar, predominate;
where greasy cards are shuffled, and bad cigars smoked
of an evening, you might have found Ruth and her children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, what do you think of her?&rdquo; said a low-browed,
pig-faced, thick-lipped fellow, with a flashy neck-tie and
vest, over which several yards of gilt watch-chain were
festooned ostentatiously; &ldquo;prettyish, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deuced nice form,&rdquo; said Jim, lighting a cheap cigar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and hitching his heels to the mantel, as he took the first
whiff; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind kissing her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You?</em>&rdquo; said Sam, glancing in an opposite mirror; &ldquo;I
flatter myself you would stand a poor chance when your
humble servant was round. If I had not made myself
scarce, out of friendship, you would not have made such
headway with black-eyed Sue, the little milliner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;Susan Gill was delf, this little
widow is porcelain; I say it is a deuced pity she should
stay up stairs, crying her eyes out, the way she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to marry her, hey?&rdquo; said Sam, with a sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I; none of your ready-made families for me;
pretty foot, hasn&rsquo;t she? I always put on my coat in the
front entry, about the time she goes up stairs, to get a
peep at it. It is a confounded pretty foot, Sam, bless
me if it isn&rsquo;t; I should like to drive the owner of it
out to the race-course, some pleasant afternoon. I must
say, Sam, I like widows. I don&rsquo;t know any occupation
more interesting than helping to dry up their tears; and
then the little dears are so grateful for any little attention.
Wonder if my swallow-tailed coat won&rsquo;t be done
to-day? that rascally tailor ought to be snipped with his
own shears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I wonder when you gentlemen intend
taking yourselves off, and quitting the drawing-room,&rdquo;
said the loud-voiced landlady, perching a cap over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
disheveled tresses; &ldquo;this parlor is the only place I
have to dress in; can&rsquo;t you do your talking and smoking
in your own rooms? Come now&mdash;here&rsquo;s a lot of newspapers,
just take them and be off, and give a woman a
chance to make herself beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, &ldquo;the old dragon! she
would make a good scarecrow for a corn-field, or a figure-head
for a piratical cruiser; beautiful!&rdquo; and the
speaker smoothed a wrinkle out of his flashy yellow
vest; &ldquo;it is my opinion that the uglier a woman is, the
more beautiful she thinks herself; also, that any of the
sex may be bought with a yard of ribbon, or a breastpin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t have lived to
this time of life to have made that discovery; and speaking
of that, reminds me that the little widow is as poor
as Job&rsquo;s turkey. My washerwoman, confound her for
ironing off my shirt-buttons, says that she wears her
clothes rough-dry, because she can&rsquo;t afford to pay for both
washing and ironing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does?&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll get tired of that
after awhile. I shall request &lsquo;the dragon,&rsquo; to-morrow, to
let me sit next her at the table. I&rsquo;ll begin by helping the
children, offering to cut up their victuals, and all that sort
of thing&mdash;that will please the mother, you know; hey?
But, by Jove! it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock, and I engaged to drive
a gen&rsquo;lemen down to the steamboat landing; now some
other hackney coach will get the job. Confound it!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Counting</span> houses, like all other spots beyond the
pale of female jurisdiction, are comfortless looking
places. The counting-room of Mr. Tom Develin was
no exception to the above rule; though we will do
him the justice to give in our affidavit, that the ink-stand,
for seven consecutive years, had stood precisely in the
same spot, bounded on the north by a box of letter
stamps, on the south by a package of brown business envelopes,
on the east by a pen wiper, made originally in the
form of a butterfly, but which frequent ink dabs had
transmuted into a speckled caterpillar, on the west by
half sheets of blank paper, rescued economically from
business letters, to save too prodigal consumption of
foolscap.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that Mr. Tom Develin was a
bachelor; perpendicular as a ram-rod, moving over <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra
firma</i> as if fearful his joints would unhinge, or his spinal
column slip into his boots; carrying his <em>arms</em> with military
precision; supporting his ears with a collar, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
known by &lsquo;the oldest inhabitant&rsquo; to be limpsey; and
stepping circumspectly in boots of mirror-like brightness,
never defiled with the mud of the world.</p>

<p>Perched on his apple-sized head, over plastered wind-proof
locks, was the shiniest of hats, its wearer turning
neither to the right nor the left; and, although possessed
of a looking-glass, laboring under the hallucination that
<em>he</em>, of all masculine moderns, was most dangerous to the
female heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Develin&rsquo;s book store was on the west side of
Literary Row. His windows were adorned with placards
of new theological publications of the blue-school
order, and engravings of departed saints, who with their
last breath had, with mock humility, requested brother
somebody to write their obituaries. There was, also, to
be seen there an occasional oil painting &ldquo;for sale,&rdquo; selected
by Mr. Develin himself, with a peculiar eye to the
greenness of the trees, the blueness of the sky, and the
moral &ldquo;tone&rdquo; of the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Develin congratulated himself on his extensive acquaintance
with clergymen, professors of colleges, students,
scholars, and the literati generally. By dint of
patient listening to their desultory conversations, he had
picked up threads of information on literary subjects,
which he carefully wound around his memory, to be
woven into his own tête-à-têtes, where such information
would &ldquo;tell;&rdquo; always, of course, omitting quotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
marks, to which some writers, as well as conversationists,
have a constitutional aversion. It is not surprising, therefore,
that his tête-à-têtes should be on the <em>mosaic</em> order;
the listener&rsquo;s interest being heightened by the fact, that
he had not, when in a state of pinafore, cultivated Lindley
Murray too assiduously.</p>

<p>Mr. Develin had fostered his bump of caution with a
truly praiseworthy care. He meddled very gingerly
with new publications; in fact, transacted business on the
old fogy, stage-coach, rub-a-dub principle; standing back
with distended eyes, and suppressed breath, in holy horror
of the whistle, whiz-rush and steam of modern publishing
houses. &ldquo;A penny saved, is a penny gained,&rdquo;
said this eminent financier and stationer, as he used <em>half
a wafer</em> to seal his business letters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any letters this morning?&rdquo; said Mr. Develin to
his clerk, as he deposited his umbrella in the northwest
corner of his counting-room, and re-smoothed his
unctuous, unruffled locks; &ldquo;any letters?&rdquo; and taking a
package from the clerk&rsquo;s hand, he circumspectly lowered
himself between his coat-tails into an arm-chair, and
leisurely proceeded to their inspection.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Develin</span>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I take the liberty, knowing you to be one of
the referees about our son&rsquo;s estate, which was left in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
dreadful confusion, owing probably to his wife&rsquo;s thriftlessness,
to request of you a small favor. When our
son died, he left a great many clothes, vests, coats, pants,
<abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which his wife, no doubt, urged his buying, and
which, of course, can be of no use to her now, as she
never had any boys, which we always regretted. I take
my pen in hand to request you to send the clothes to me,
as they will save my tailor&rsquo;s bill; please send, also, a circular
broadcloth cloak, faced with velvet, his cane, hats,
and our son&rsquo;s Bible, which Ruth, of course, never looks
into&mdash;we wish to use it at family prayers. Please send
them all at your earliest convenience. Hoping you are
in good health, I am yours to command,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Zekiel Hall.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Develin re-folded the letter, crossed his legs and
mused. &ldquo;The law allows the widow the husband&rsquo;s wearing
apparel, but what can Ruth do with it? (as the doctor
says, she has no boys,) and with her <em>peculiar notions</em>,
it is not probable she would sell the clothes. The law is
on her side, undoubtedly, but luckily she knows no more
about law than a baby; she is poor, the doctor is a man
of property; Ruth&rsquo;s husband was my friend to be sure,
but a man must look out for No. 1 in this world, and
consider a little what would be for his own interest.
The doctor may leave me a little slice of property if I
keep on the right side of him, who knows? The clothes
must be sent.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t</span> a pretty place,&rdquo; said little Katy, as she
looked out the window upon a row of brick walls,
dingy sheds, and discolored chimneys; &ldquo;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t a pretty
place, mother, I want to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; Ruth started! the word struck a chord
which vibrated&mdash;oh how painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why <em>don&rsquo;t</em> we go home, mother?&rdquo; continued Katy;
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t papa ever, ever, come and take us away? there
is something in my throat which makes me want to cry
all the time, mother,&rdquo; and Katy leaned her curly head
wearily on her mother&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Ruth took the child on her lap, and averting her eyes,
said with a forced smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little sister don&rsquo;t cry, Katy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she is a little baby, and don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo;
replied Katy; &ldquo;she used to stay with Biddy, but
papa used to take me to walk, and toss me up to the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
when he came home, and make rabbits with his fingers
on the wall after tea, and take me on his knee and tell
me about little Red Riding Hood, and&mdash;oh, I want papa,
I want papa,&rdquo; said the child, with a fresh burst of tears.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s tears fell like rain on Katy&rsquo;s little up-turned
face. Oh, how could she, who so much needed comfort,
speak words of cheer? How could her tear-dimmed eyes
and palsied hand, &rsquo;mid the gloom of so dark a night, see,
and arrest a sunbeam?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, dear, kiss me; you <em>loved</em> papa&mdash;it grieved you
to see him sick and suffering. Papa has gone to heaven,
where there is no more sickness, no more pain. Papa is
happy now, Katy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy? without <em>me</em>, and <em>you</em>, and <em>Nettie</em>,&rdquo; said
Katy, with a grieved lip?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, far-reaching&mdash;questioning childhood, who is sufficient
for thee? How can lips, which so stammeringly
repeat, &lsquo;thy will be done,&rsquo; teach <em>thee</em> the lesson perfect?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Good</span> morning, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said Mr. Develin,
handing Ruth the doctor&rsquo;s letter, and seating
himself at what he considered a safe distance from a
female; &ldquo;I received that letter from the doctor this
morning, and I think it would be well for you to attend
to his request as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth perused the letter, and handed it back with a
trembling hand, saying, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis true the clothes are of no
use, but it is a great comfort to me, Mr. Develin, to keep
everything that once belonged to Harry.&rdquo; Then pausing
a moment, she asked, &ldquo;have they a <em>legal</em> right to demand
those things, Mr. Develin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not very well versed in law,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Develin, dodging the unexpected question; &ldquo;but you
know the doctor doesn&rsquo;t bear thwarting, and your children&mdash;in
fact&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr. Develin twisted his thumbs
and seemed rather at a loss. &ldquo;Well, the fact is, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Hall, in the present state of your affairs, you cannot
afford to refuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Ruth, mournfully, &ldquo;true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry&rsquo;s clothes were collected from the drawers, one
by one, and laid upon the sofa. Now a little pencilled
memorandum fluttered from the pocket; now a handkerchief
dropped upon the floor, slightly odorous of
cologne, or cigars; neck-ties there were, shaped by his
full round throat, with the creases still in the silken folds,
and there was a crimson smoking cap, Ruth&rsquo;s gift&mdash;the
gilt tassel slightly tarnished where it had touched the
moist dark locks; then his dressing-gown, which Ruth
herself had often playfully thrown on, while combing her
hair&mdash;each had its little history, each its tender home
associations, daguerreotyping, on tortured memory, sunny
pictures of the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I cannot&mdash;I cannot,&rdquo; said Ruth, as her eye fell
upon Harry&rsquo;s wedding-vest; &ldquo;oh, Mr. Develin, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Develin coughed, hemmed, walked to the window,
drew off his gloves, and drew them on, and finally said,
anxious to terminate the interview, &ldquo;I can fold them up
quicker than you, Mrs. Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; replied Ruth, sinking into a chair;
&ldquo;<em>this</em> you will leave me, Mr. Develin,&rdquo; pointing to the
white satin vest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Yes">Y-e-s</strong>,&rdquo; said Mr. Develin, with an attempt to be facetious.
&ldquo;The old doctor can&rsquo;t use that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The trunk was packed, the key turned in the lock, and
the porter in waiting, preceded by Mr. Develin, shouldered
his burden, and followed him down stairs, and out into
the street.</p>

<p>And there sat Ruth, with the tears dropping one after
another upon the wedding vest, over which her fingers
strayed caressingly. Oh, where was the heart which had
throbbed so tumultuously beneath it, on that happy bridal
eve? With what a dirge-like echo fell upon her tortured
ear those bridal words,&mdash;&ldquo;till death do us part.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Tom</span> Herbert, are you aware that this is the sixth
spoonful of sugar you have put in that cup of tea?
and what a forlorn face! I&rsquo;d as lief look at a tombstone.
Now look at <em>me</em>. Did you ever see such a fit as that
boot? Is not my hair as smooth and as glossy as if I
expected to dine with some other gentleman than my
husband? Is not this jacket a miracle of shapeliness?
Look what a foil you are to all this loveliness; lack-lustre

<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said her husband, without noticing her raillery;
&ldquo;do you remember Mrs. Hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; replied Mary; &ldquo;oh, Ruth Ellet? yes;
I used to go to school with her. She has lost her husband,
they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a fine noble fellow he was too, and very
proud of his wife. I remember he used to come into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
store, and say, with one of his pleasant smiles, &lsquo;Herbert,
I wonder if you have anything here handsome enough for
my wife to wear.&rsquo; He bought all her clothes himself,
even to her gloves and boots, and was as tender and careful
of her as if she were an infant. Well, to-day she
came into my store, dressed in deep mourning, leading
her two little girls by the hand, and asked to see me.
And what do you think she wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mary, carelessly; &ldquo;a
yard of black crape, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wanted to know,&rdquo; said Mr. Herbert, &ldquo;if I could
employ her to make up and trim those lace collars, caps,
and under sleeves we sell at the store. I tell you, Mary,
I could scarce keep the tears out of my eyes, she looked
so sad. And then those poor little children, Mary! I
thought of you, and how terrible it would be if you and
our little Sue and Charley were left so destitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destitute?&rdquo; replied Mary; &ldquo;why her father is a man
of property; her brother is in prosperous circumstances;
and her cousin lives in one of the most fashionable squares
in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, wife, I know it; and that makes it all the harder
for Mrs. Hall to get employment; because, people knowing
this, take it for granted that her relatives help her, or
<em>ought</em> to, and prefer to give employment to others whom
they imagine need it more. This is natural, and perhaps I
should have thought so too, had it been anybody but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Harry Hall&rsquo;s wife; but all I could think of was, what
Harry (poor fellow!) <em>would</em> have said, had he ever
thought his little pet of a wife would have come begging
to me for employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell her?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;you know the kind of work she wished, is
done by forty hands, in a room directly over the store,
under the superintendence of Betsy Norris; of course,
they would <em>all</em> prefer doing the work at home, to coming
down there to do it; but that is against our rules.
I told her this, and also that if I made an exception in
her favor, the forewoman would know it, because she had
to prepare the work, and that would cause dissatisfaction
among my hands. What do you think she said? she
offered to come and sit down among those girls, and work
<em>with</em> them. My God, Mary! Harry Hall&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that was out of the question, wife, for she
could not bring her two children there, and she had no
one to leave them with, and so she went away; and I
looked after her, and those little bits of children, till they
were out of sight, trying to devise some way to get her
employment. Cannot you think of anything, Mary?
Are there no ladies you know, who would give her nice
needlework?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody but Mrs. Slade,&rdquo; replied
Mary, &ldquo;who puts out work of any consequence, and she
told me the other day that she never employed any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
those persons who &lsquo;had seen better days;&rsquo; that somehow
she couldn&rsquo;t drive as good a bargain with them as
she could with a common person, who was ignorant of
the value of their labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help poor Mrs. Hall, then,&rdquo; exclaimed Harry,
&ldquo;if <em>all</em> the sex are as heartless! <em>We</em> must contrive
some way to help her, Mary&mdash;help her to <em>employment</em>, I
mean, for I know her well enough to be sure that she
would accept of assistance in no other way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Is</span> this the house?&rdquo; said one of two ladies, pausing
before Ruth&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied the other lady; &ldquo;they said it
was No. 50 &mdash;&mdash; street, but it can&rsquo;t be, either; Ruth Hall
couldn&rsquo;t live in such a place as this. Just look at that
red-faced Irish girl leaning out the front window on her
elbows, and see those vulgar red bar-room curtains; I
declare, Mary, if Ruth Hall has got down hill so far as
this, <em>I</em> can&rsquo;t keep up her acquaintance; just see how they
stare at us here! if you choose to call you may&mdash;faugh!
just smell that odor of cabbage issuing from the first
entry. Come, come, Mary, take your hand off the
knocker; I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen in that vulgar house for a
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems <em>heartless</em>, though,&rdquo; said the other lady, blushing
slightly, as she gathered up her six flounces in her
delicately gloved-hand; &ldquo;do you remember the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
we rode out to their pretty country-seat, and had
that delicious supper of strawberries and cream, under
those old trees? and do you remember how handsome
and picturesque her husband looked in that broad Panama
hat, raking up the hay when the thunder-shower
came up? and how happy Ruth looked, and her children?
&rsquo;Tis a dreadful change for her, I declare; if it were me, I
believe I should cut my throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is probably just what her relatives would like
to have her do,&rdquo; replied Mary, laughing; &ldquo;they are as
much mortified at her being here, as you and I are to be
seen in such a quarter of the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they provide for her, then,&rdquo; said the other
lady, &ldquo;at least till she can turn round? that youngest
child is only a baby yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s <em>their</em> affair,&rdquo; answered Mary, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother
about it. Hyacinth has just married a rich, fashionable
wife, and of course he cannot lose caste by associating
with Ruth now; you cannot blame him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that don&rsquo;t prevent him from <em>helping</em> her, does
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Gertrude, do stop! if there&rsquo;s anything
I hate, it is an argument. It is clearly none of our
business to take her up, if her own people don&rsquo;t do it.
Come, go to La Temps with me, and get an ice.
What a love of a collar you have on; it is handsomer
than mine, which I gave fifty dollars for, but what is fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dollars, when one fancies a thing? If I didn&rsquo;t make my
husband&rsquo;s money fly, his second wife would; so I will
save her ladyship that trouble;&rdquo; and with an arch toss of
her plumed head, the speaker and her companion entered
the famous saloon of La Temps, where might be seen
any sunny day, between the hours of twelve and three,
the disgusting spectacle of scores of ladies devouring, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
infinitum</i>, brandy-drops, Roman punch, Charlotte Russe,
pies, cakes, and ices; and sipping &ldquo;parfait amour,&rdquo; till
their flushed cheeks and emancipated tongues prepared
them to listen and reply to any amount of questionable
nonsense from their attendant roué cavaliers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Some</span> folks&rsquo; pride runs in queer streaks,&rdquo; said
Betty, as she turned a beefsteak on the gridiron;
&ldquo;if I lived in such a grand house as this, and had so
many fine clothes, I wouldn&rsquo;t let my poor cousin stand
every Monday in my kitchen, bending over the wash-tub,
and rubbing out her clothes and her children&rsquo;s, with my
servants, till the blood started from her knuckles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what dis chil&rsquo; would do, if she were
Missis Ruth Hall?&rdquo; asked Gatty. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;d jess go
right up on dat shed fronting de street, wid &rsquo;em, and
hang &rsquo;em right out straight before all de grand neighbors,
and shame Missus Millet; dat&rsquo;s what <em>dis</em> chil&rsquo; would
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Ruth, she knows too much for that,&rdquo; replied
Betty; &ldquo;she shoulders that great big basket of
damp clothes and climbs up one, two, three, four flights
of stairs to hang them to dry in the garret. Did you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
her sit down on the stairs last Monday, looking so pale
about the mouth, and holding on to her side, as if she
never would move again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Gatty, &ldquo;and here now, jess look at de
fust peaches of de season, sent in for dessert; de Lor&rsquo;
he only knows what dey cost, but niggers musn&rsquo;t see
noffing, not dey, if dey wants to keep dere place. But
white folks <em>is</em> stony-hearted, Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn that steak over,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;now get the
pepper; work and talk too, that&rsquo;s <em>my</em> motto. Yes, Gatty,
I remember when Mrs. Ruth&rsquo;s husband used to ride
up to the door of a fine morning, and toss me a large bouquet
for Mrs. Millet, which Mrs. Ruth had tied up for
her, or hand me a box of big strawberries, or a basket
of plums, or pears, and how all our folks here would
go out there and stay as long as they liked, and use the
horses, and pick the fruit, and the like of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s her brudder, Massa Hyacinth? Wonder if
<em>he</em> knows how tings is gwyin on?&rdquo; asked Gatty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> knows fast enough, only he <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know,&rdquo; replied
Betty, with a sly wink. &ldquo;I was setting the table the
other day, when Mrs. Millet read a letter from him to
her husband. It seems he&rsquo;s got a fine place in the country,
where he lives with his new bride. Poor thing, I
hope he won&rsquo;t break her heart, as he did his first wife&rsquo;s.
Well, he told how beautiful his place was, and how much
money he had laid out on his garden, and hot-house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
things, and invited Mrs. Millet to come and see him;
and then he said, &lsquo;he &rsquo;sposed Mrs. Ruth was getting on;
he didn&rsquo;t know anything about her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know about de debbel!&rdquo; exclaimed Gatty, throwing
down the pepper castor; &ldquo;wonder whose fault dat is,
Betty? &rsquo;Spose all dese folks of ours, up stairs, will go
to de bressed place? When I heard Massa Millet
have prayers dis morning, I jess wanted to ask him dat.
You &rsquo;member what our minister, Mr. Snowball, said las&rsquo;
Sunday, &rsquo;bout de parabola of Dives and Lazarus, hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parable,&rdquo; said Betty contemptuously; &ldquo;Gatty, you
are as ignorant as a hippopotamus. Come, see that
steak now, done to a crisp; won&rsquo;t you catch it when you
take it into breakfast. It is lucky I can cook and talk
too.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Something</span> for you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the maid-of-all-work
to Ruth, omitting the ceremony of a premonitory
knock, as she opened the door. &ldquo;A bunch of flowers!
handsome enough for Queen Victory; and a basket
of apples all done up in green leaves. It takes widders
to get presents,&rdquo; said the girl, stowing away her tongue
in her left cheek, as she partially closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed little Nettie, to whom
those flowers were as fair as Eve&rsquo;s first view of Paradise.
&ldquo;Give me <em>one</em> posy, mamma, only <em>one</em>;&rdquo; and the little
chubby hands were outstretched for a tempting rose-bud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nettie, dear, they are not for me,&rdquo; said Ruth;
&ldquo;there must be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the girl, thrusting her head
into the half-open door; &ldquo;the boy said they were &lsquo;for
Mrs. Ruth Hall,&rsquo; as plain as the nose on my face; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that&rsquo;s plain enough, for I reckon I should have got married
long ago, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for my big nose. He
was a country boy like, with a ploughman&rsquo;s frock on, and
was as spotted in the face as a tiger-lily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know,&rdquo; replied Ruth, with a ray of her old
sunshiny smile flitting over her face; &ldquo;it was Johnny
Galt; he comes into market every day with vegetables.
Don&rsquo;t you remember him, Katy? He used to drive
our old Brindle to pasture, and milk her every night.
You know dear papa gave him a suit of clothes on the
Fourth of July, and a new hat, and leave to go to
Plymouth to see his mother? Don&rsquo;t you remember,
Katy, he used to catch butterflies for you in the meadow,
and pick you nosegays of buttercups, and let you ride
the pony to water, and show you where the little minnies
lived in the brook? Have you forgotten the white
chicken he brought you in his hat, which cried &lsquo;peep&mdash;peep,&rsquo;
and the cunning little speckled eggs he found for
you in the woods, and the bright scarlet partridge berries
he strung for a necklace for your throat, and the glossy
green-oak-leaf-wreath he made for your hat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell more&mdash;tell more,&rdquo; said Katy, with eyes brimming
with joy; &ldquo;smile more, mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aye, &ldquo;Smile more, mamma.&rdquo; Earth has its bright
spots; there must have been sunshine to make a shadow.
All hearts are not calloused by selfishness; from the lips
of the honest little donor goeth up each night and morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a prayer, sincere and earnest, for &ldquo;the widow and the
fatherless.&rdquo; The noisome, flaunting weeds of earth have
not wholly choked the modest flower of gratitude.
&ldquo;Smile more, mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How cheap a thing is happiness! Golconda&rsquo;s mines
were dross to that simple bunch of flowers! They lit
the widow&rsquo;s gloomy room with a celestial brightness.
Upon the dingy carpet Ruth placed the little vase, and
dimpled limbs hovered about their brilliant petals; poising
themselves daintily as the epicurean butterfly who
circles, in dreamy delight, over the rose&rsquo;s heart, longing,
yet delaying to sip its sweets.</p>

<p>A simple bunch of flowers, yet oh, the tale they told
with their fragrant breath! &ldquo;Smile, mamma!&rdquo; for those
gleeful children&rsquo;s sake; send back to the source that
starting tear, ere like a lowering cloud it o&rsquo;ercasts the
sunshine of those beaming faces.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;My</span> dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Millet as the servant withdrew
with the dessert, &ldquo;Walter has an invitation to the
Hon. David Greene&rsquo;s to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No response from Mr. Millet, &ldquo;the wooden man,&rdquo; one
of whose pleasant peculiarities it was never to answer a
question till the next day after it was addressed to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millet, quite broken in to this little conjugal eccentricity,
proceeded; &ldquo;It will be a good thing for John,
Mr. Millet; I am anxious that all his acquaintances
should be of the right sort. Hyacinth has often told me
how much it made or marred a boy&rsquo;s fortune, the set he
associated with. Herbert Greene has the air of a thorough-bred
man already. You see now, Mr. Millet, the
importance of Hyacinth&rsquo;s advice to us about five years
ago, to move into a more fashionable neighborhood; to
be sure rents are rather high here, but I am very sure
young Snyder would never have thought of offering himself
to Leila had not we lived at the court-end of the
town. Hyacinth considers it a great catch in point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
family, and I have no doubt Snyder is a nice fellow. I
wish before you go, Mr. Millet, you would leave the
money to buy Leila a velvet jacket; it will not cost more
than forty dollars (lace, trimmings, and all); it will be
very becoming to Leila. What, going? oh, I forgot to
tell you, that Ruth&rsquo;s father was here this morning, bothering
me just as I was dressing my hair for dinner. It
seems that he is getting tired of furnishing the allowance
he promised to give Ruth, and says that it is <em>our</em> turn
now to do something. He is a great deal better off than
we are, and so I told him; and also, that we were obliged
to live in a certain style for the dear children&rsquo;s sake;
beside, are we <em>not</em> doing something for her? I allow
Ruth to do her washing in our kitchen every week, provided
she finds her own soap. Stop a minute, Mr. Millet;
<em>do</em> leave the forty dollars for Leila&rsquo;s jacket before you
go. Cicchi, the artist, wants her to sit for a Madonna,&mdash;quite
a pretty tribute to Leila&rsquo;s beauty; he only charges
three hundred dollars; his study is No. 1, Clive street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Studio">S-t-u-d-i-o</strong>,&rdquo; said Mr. Millet, (slowly and oracularly,
who, being on several school committees, thought it his
duty to make an extra exertion, when the king&rsquo;s English
was misapplied;) &ldquo;<strong title="studio">s-t-u-d-i-o</strong>, Mrs. Millet;&rdquo; and buttoning
the eighth button of his overcoat, he moved slowly out
the front door, and down the street to his counting-room,
getting over the ground with about as much flexibility
and grace of motion as the wooden horses on the stage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Come</span> here, Katy,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;do you think you
could go <em>alone</em> to your grandfather Ellet&rsquo;s for once?
My board bill is due to-day, and my head is so giddy
with this pain, that I can hardly lift it from the pillow.
Don&rsquo;t you think you can go without me, dear? Mrs.
Skiddy is very particular about being paid the moment
she sends in her bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, mamma,&rdquo; replied little Katy, unwilling to
disoblige her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then bring your bonnet, dear, and let me tie it; be
very, very careful crossing the streets, and don&rsquo;t loiter on
the way. I have been hoping every moment to be better,
but I cannot go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, mother,&rdquo; said Katy, struggling bravely
with her reluctance, as she kissed her mother&rsquo;s cheek, and
smiled a good-bye; but when she gained the crowded
street, the smile faded away from the little face, her steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
were slow, and her eyes downcast; for Katy, child as
she was, knew that her grandfather was never glad to see
them now, and his strange, cold tone when he spoke to
her, always made her shiver; so little Katy threaded her
way along, with a troubled, anxious, care-worn look,
never glancing in at the shopkeepers&rsquo; tempting windows,
and quite forgetting Johnny Galt&rsquo;s pretty bunch of flowers,
till she stood trembling with her hand on the latch
of her grandfather&rsquo;s counting-room door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That <em>you</em>!&rdquo; said her grandfather gruffly, from under
his bent brows; &ldquo;come for money <em>again</em>? Do you think
your grandfather is made of money? people have to
<em>earn</em> it, did you know that? I worked hard to earn
mine. Have you done any thing to earn this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; said Katy, with a culprit look, twisting
the corner of her apron, and struggling to keep from
crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t your mother go to work and earn something?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Ellet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot get any work to do,&rdquo; replied Katy; &ldquo;she
tries very hard, grandpa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell her to <em>keep on</em> trying, and you must grow
up quick, and earn something too; money don&rsquo;t grow on
trees, or bushes, did you know that? What&rsquo;s the
reason your mother didn&rsquo;t come after it herself, hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is sick,&rdquo; said Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me she&rsquo;s always sick. Well, there&rsquo;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
dollar,&rdquo; said her grandfather, looking at the bill affectionately,
as he parted with it; &ldquo;if you keep on coming here
at this rate, you will get all my money away. Do you
think it is right to come and get all my money away,
hey? Remember now, you and your mother must earn
some, <em>somehow</em>, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; said Katy meekly, as she closed the door.</p>

<p>There was a great noise and bustle in the street, and
Katy was jostled hither and thither by the hurrying foot
passengers; but she did not heed it, she was so busy
thinking of what her grandfather had said, and wondering
if she could not sell matches, or shavings, or sweep the
crossings, or earn some pennies somehow, that she need
never go to her grandfather again. Just then a little girl
her own age, came skipping and smiling along, holding
her father&rsquo;s hand. Katy looked at her and thought of
<em>her</em> father, and then she began to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, my dear?&rdquo; said a gentleman,
lifting a handful of Katy&rsquo;s shining curls from her face;
&ldquo;why do you cry, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want <em>my</em> papa,&rdquo; sobbed Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he, dear? tell me, and I will take you to
him, shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Sir,&rdquo; said Katy, innocently, &ldquo;he has
gone to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help you,&rdquo; said the gentleman, with moistened
eyes, &ldquo;where had you been when I met you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I had rather not tell,&rdquo; replied
Katy, with a crimson blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very odd, this,&rdquo; muttered the gentleman; &ldquo;what is
your name, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy what?&rdquo; asked the gentleman. &ldquo;Katy-did, I
think! for your voice is as sweet as a bird&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy Hall, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hall? Hall?&rdquo; repeated the gentleman, thoughtfully;
&ldquo;was your father&rsquo;s name Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he tall and handsome, with black hair and
whiskers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>so</em> handsome,&rdquo; replied Katy, with sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he live at a place called &lsquo;The Glen,&rsquo; just out
of the city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child, my poor child,&rdquo; said the gentleman, taking
her up in his arms and pushing back her hair from her
face; &ldquo;yes, here is papa&rsquo;s brow, and his clear, blue eyes,
Katy. I used to know your dear papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Katy, with a bright, glad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to go to his counting-house to talk to him on
business, and I learned to love him very much, too. I
never saw your mamma, though I often heard him speak
of her. In a few hours, dear, I am going to sail off on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the great ocean, else I would go home with you and see
your mamma. Where do you live, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In &mdash;&mdash; court,&rdquo; said the child. The gentleman colored
and started, then putting his hand in his pocket and
drawing out something that looked like paper, slipped it
into little Katy&rsquo;s bag, saying, with delicate tact, &ldquo;Tell
your mamma, my dear, that is something I owed your
dear papa; mind you carry it home safely; now give
me a good-bye kiss, and may God forever bless you, my
darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Katy stood shading her eyes with her hand till
the gentleman was out of sight; it was so nice to see
somebody who &ldquo;loved papa;&rdquo; and then she wondered
why her grandfather never spoke so to her about him;
and then she wished the kind gentleman were her grandpapa;
and then she wondered what it was he had put in
the bag for mamma; and then she recollected that her
mamma told her &ldquo;not to loiter;&rdquo; and then she quickened
her tardy little feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Katy</span> had been gone now a long while. Ruth began
to grow anxious. She lifted her head from the pillow,
took off the wet bandage from her aching forehead,
and taking little Nettie upon her lap, sat down at the
small window to watch for Katy. The prospect was not
one to call up cheerful fancies. Opposite was one of
those large brick tenements, let out by rapacious landlords,
a room at a time at griping rents, to poor emigrants,
and others, who were barely able to prolong
their lease of life from day to day. At one window sat a
tailor, with his legs crossed, and a torn straw hat perched
awry upon his head, cutting and making coarse garments
for the small clothing-store in the vicinity, whose Jewish
owner reaped all the profits. At another, a pale-faced
woman, with a handkerchief bound round her aching face,
bent over a steaming wash-tub, while a little girl of ten,
staggering under the weight of a basket of damp clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was stringing them on lines across the room to dry. At
the next window sat a decrepit old woman, feebly trying
to soothe in her palsied arms the wailings of a poor
sick child. And there, too, sat a young girl, from dawn
till dark, scarcely lifting that pallid face and weary
eyes&mdash;stitching and thinking, thinking and stitching. God
help her!</p>

<p>Still, tier above tier the windows rose, full of pale,
anxious, care-worn faces&mdash;never a laugh, never a song&mdash;but
instead, ribald curses, and the cries of neglected, half-fed
children. From window to window, outside, were
strung on lines articles of clothing, pails, baskets, pillows,
feather-beds, and torn coverlets; while up and
down the door-steps, in and out, passed ever a ragged
procession of bare-footed women and children, to the
small grocery opposite, for &ldquo;a pint of milk,&rdquo; a &ldquo;loaf of
bread,&rdquo; a few onions, or potatoes, a cabbage, some herrings,
a sixpence worth of poor tea, a pound of musty
flour, a few candles, or a peck of coal&mdash;for all of which,
the poor creatures paid twice as much as if they had the
means to buy by the quantity.</p>

<p>The only window which Ruth did not shudder to look
at, was the upper one of all, inhabited by a large but
thrifty German family, whose love of flowers had taken
root even in that sterile soil, and whose little pot of
thriving foreign shrubs, outside the window sill, showed
with what tenacity the heart will cling to early associations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Further on, at one block&rsquo;s remove, was a more pretentious-looking
house, the blinds of which were almost
always closed, save when the colored servants threw them
open once a day, to give the rooms an airing. Then
Ruth saw damask chairs, satin curtains, pictures, vases,
books, and pianos; it was odd that people who could
afford such things should live in such a neighborhood.
Ruth looked and wondered. Throngs of visitors went
there&mdash;carriages rolled up to the door, and rolled away;
gray-haired men, business men, substantial-looking family
men, and foppish-looking young men; while half-grown
boys loitered about the premises, looking mysteriously
into the door when it opened, or into the window
when a curtain was raised, or a blind flew apart.</p>

<p>Now and then a woman appeared at the windows.
Sometimes the face was young and fair, sometimes it was
wan and haggard; but, oh God! never without the stain
that the bitterest tear may fail to wash away, save in the
eyes of Him whose voice of mercy whispered, &ldquo;Go, and
sin no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s tears fell fast. She knew now how it could be,
when every door of hope seemed shut, by those who make
long prayers and wrap themselves in morality as with a
garment, and cry with closed purses and averted faces,
&ldquo;Be ye warmed, and filled.&rdquo; She knew now how,
when the heart, craving sympathy, craving companionship,
doubting both earth and heaven, may wreck its all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in one despairing moment on that dark sea, if it lose
sight of Bethlehem&rsquo;s guiding-star. And then, she
thought, &ldquo;if he who saveth a soul from death shall hide a
multitude of sins,&rdquo; oh! where, in the great reckoning-day,
shall <em>he</em> be found who, &rsquo;mid the gloom of so dark a
night, pilots such struggling bark on wrecking rocks?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear child, I am so glad you are home,&rdquo; said Ruth,
as Katy opened the door; &ldquo;I began to fear something had
happened to you. Did you see your grandfather?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Katy, &ldquo;please never send
me to my grandpa again; he said we &lsquo;should get away
all the money he had,&rsquo; and he looked so dreadful when he
said it, that it made my knees tremble. Is it stealing,
mamma, for us to take grandpa&rsquo;s money away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ruth, looking a hue more pallid, if possible,
than before, &ldquo;No, no, Katy, don&rsquo;t cry; you shall
never go there again for money. But, where is your
bag? Why! what&rsquo;s this, Katy. Grandpa has made a
mistake. You must run right back as quick as ever you
can with this money, or I&rsquo;m afraid he will be angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, grandpa didn&rsquo;t give me that,&rdquo; said Katy; &ldquo;a
gentleman gave me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman?&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Why it is <em>money</em>, Katy.
How came you to take money from a gentleman? Who
was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; exclaimed Katy. &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; clapping her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hands. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so glad. He didn&rsquo;t say it was money;
he said it was something he owed papa;&rdquo; and little
Katy picked up a card from the floor, on which was
pencilled, &ldquo;For the children of Harry Hall, from their
father&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; whispered Katy to Nettie, &ldquo;mamma is
praying.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, I never!&rdquo; said Biddy, bursting into Ruth&rsquo;s
room in her usual thunder-clap way, and seating
herself on the edge of a chair, as she polished her face
with the skirt of her dress. &ldquo;As sure as my name is
Biddy, I don&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or to cry. Well,
I&rsquo;ve been expecting it. Folks that have ears can&rsquo;t help
hearing when folks quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Who
has quarreled? It is nothing that concerns me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it though?&rdquo; replied Biddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it
<em>will</em> concern ye to pack up bag and baggage, and be off
out of the house; for that&rsquo;s what we are all coming to,
and all for Mrs. Skiddy. You see it&rsquo;s just here, ma&rsquo;am.
Masther has been threatnin&rsquo; for a long time to go to
Californy, where the gould is as plenty as blackberries.
Well, misthress tould him, if ever he said the like o&rsquo; that
again, he&rsquo;d rue it; and you know, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s she that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
has a temper. Well, yesterday I heard high words
again; and, sure enough, after dinner to-day, she went off,
taking Sammy and Johnny, and laving the bit nursing
baby on his hands, and the boarders and all. And it&rsquo;s
Biddy McFlanigan who&rsquo;ll be off, ma&rsquo;am, and not be
made a pack-horse of, to tend that teething child, and be
here, and there, and everywhere in a minute. And so
I come to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Biddy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afther keeping me, ma&rsquo;am; Pat has shouldhered
me trunk, and ye see I can&rsquo;t be staying when
things is as they is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incessant cries of Mrs. Skiddy&rsquo;s bereaved baby
soon bore ample testimony to the truth of Biddy&rsquo;s narration,
appealing to Ruth&rsquo;s motherly sympathies so vehemently,
that she left her room and went down to offer
her assistance.</p>

<p>There sat Mr. John Skiddy, the forlorn widower, the
ambitious Californian, in the middle of the kitchen, in his
absconded wife&rsquo;s rocking-chair, trotting a seven months&rsquo;
baby on the sharp apex of his knee, alternately singing,
whistling, and wiping the perspiration from his forehead,
while the little Skiddy threw up its arms in the most
frantic way, and held its breath with rage, at the awkward
attempts of its dry nurse to restore peace to the
family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me sweeten a little cream and water and feed
that child for you, Mr. Skiddy,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;I think he
is hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said Skiddy, with a
man&rsquo;s determined aversion to owning &lsquo;checkmated.&rsquo; &ldquo;I
am getting along famously with the little darling. Papa
<em>will</em> feed him, so he <em>will</em>,&rdquo; said Skiddy; and, turning the
maddened baby flat on his back, he poured down a whole
tea-spoonful of the liquid at once; the natural consequence
of which was a milky <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jet d&rsquo;eau</i> on his face, neckcloth,
and vest, from the irritated baby, who resented the
insult with all his mother&rsquo;s spirit.</p>

<p>Ruth adroitly looked out the window, while Mr. Skiddy
wiped his face and sopped his neckcloth, after which
she busied herself in picking up the ladles, spoons, forks,
dredging-boxes, mortars, pestles, and other culinary implements,
with which the floor was strewn, in the vain attempt
to propitiate the distracted infant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I <em>will</em> spare the little dear to you a few minutes,&rdquo;
said Skiddy, with a ghastly attempt at a smile,
&ldquo;while I run over to the bakery to get a loaf for tea.
Mrs. Skiddy has probably been unexpectedly detained,
and Biddy is so afraid of her labor in her absence, that
she has taken French leave. I shall be back soon,&rdquo; said
Skiddy, turning away in disgust from the looking-glass,
as he caught sight of his limpsey dicky and collapsed
shirt-bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth took the poor worried baby tenderly, laid it on
its stomach across her lap, then loosening its frock
strings, began rubbing its little fat shoulders with her
velvet palm. There was a maternal magnetism in that
touch; baby knew it! he stopped crying and winked his
swollen eyelids with the most luxurious satisfaction, as
much as to say, there, now, that&rsquo;s something like!</p>

<p>Gently Ruth drew first one, then the other, of the
magnetized baby&rsquo;s chubby arms from its frock sleeves,
substituting a comfortable loose night-dress for the
tight and heated frock; then she carefully drew off its
shoe, admiring the while the beauty of the little blue
veined, dimpled foot, while Katy, hush as any mouse,
looked on delightedly from her little cricket on the
hearth, and Nettie, less philosophical, was more than half
inclined to cry at what she considered an infringement of
her rights.</p>

<p>Mr. Skiddy&rsquo;s reflections as he walked to the bakery
were of a motley character. Upon the whole, he inclined
to the opinion that it was &ldquo;not good for man to be
alone,&rdquo; especially with a nursing baby. The premeditated
and unmixed malice of Mrs. Skiddy in leaving the
baby, instead of Sammy or Johnny, was beyond question.
Still, he could not believe that her desire for revenge
would outweigh all her maternal feelings. She would return
by-and-bye; but where could she have gone? People
cannot travel with an empty purse; but, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
even now, at some tantalizing point of contiguity, she
was laughing at the success of her nefarious scheme; and
Mr. Skiddy&rsquo;s face reddened at the thought, and his arms
instinctively took an a-kimbo attitude.</p>

<p>But then, perhaps, she <em>never meant</em> to come back.
What was he to do with that baby? A wet-nurse
would cost him six dollars a week; and, as to bringing
up little Tommy by hand, city milk would soon
finish him. And, to do Mr. Skiddy justice, though no
Socrates, he was a good father to his children.</p>

<p>And now it was nearly dark. Was he doomed to
sit up all night, tired as he was, with Tommy in one
hand, and a spoon and pewter porringer in the other?
Or, worse still, walk the floor in white array, till his
joints, candle, and patience gave out? Then, there were
the boarders to be seen to! He never realized before
how <em>many</em> irons Mrs. Skiddy had daily in the fire.
There was Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Johnson, on the
first floor, (and his face grew hot as he thought of it,) had
seen him in the kitchen looking so Miss-Nancy-like, as he
superintended pots, kettles, and stews. <em>Stews?</em> there
was not a dry thread on him that minute, although a cold
north wind was blowing. Never mind, he was not such
a fool as to tell of his little troubles; so he entered the
bakery and bought an extra pie, and a loaf of plum-cake,
for tea, to hoodwink the boarders into the belief that Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Skiddy&rsquo;s presence was not at all necessary to a well-provided
table.</p>

<p>Tea went off quite swimmingly, with Mr. John Skiddy
at the urn. The baby, thanks to Ruth&rsquo;s maternal management,
lay sweetly sleeping in his little wicker cradle,
dreaming of a distant land flowing with milk and honey,
and <em>looking</em> as if he was destined to a protracted nap;
although it was very perceptible that Mr. Skiddy looked
anxious when a door was shut hard, or a knife or fork
dropped on the table; and he had several times been
seen to close his teeth tightly over his lip, when a heavy
cart rumbled mercilessly past.</p>

<p>Tea being over, the boarders dispersed their various
ways; Ruth notifying Mr. Skiddy of her willingness to
take the child whenever it became unmanageable. Then
Mr. Skiddy, very gingerly, and with a cat-like tread, put
away the tea-things, muttering an imprecation at the lid
of the tea-pot, as he went, for falling off. Then, drawing the
evening paper from his pocket, and unfurling it, (with
one eye on the cradle,) he put up his weary legs and commenced
reading the news.</p>

<p>Hark! a muffled noise from the cradle! Mr. Skiddy
started, and applied his toe vigorously to the rocker&mdash;it
was no use. He whistled&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t suit. He sang&mdash;it
was a decided failure. Little Skiddy had caught sight of
the pretty bright candle, and it was his present intention
to scream till he was taken up to investigate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Miserable Skiddy! He recollected, now, alas! too
late, that Mrs. Skiddy always carefully screened the light
from Tommy&rsquo;s eyes while sleeping. He began to be
conscious of a growing respect for Mrs. Skiddy, and a
growing aversion to <em>her</em> baby. Yes; in that moment of
vexation, with that unread evening paper before him, he
actually called it <em>her</em> baby.</p>

<p>How the victimized man worried through the long
evening and night&mdash;how he tried to propitiate the little
tempest with the castor, the salt-cellar, its mother&rsquo;s work-box,
and last, but not least, a silver cup he had received
for his valor from the Atlantic Fire Company&mdash;how the
baby, all-of-a-twist, like Dickens&rsquo; young hero kept asking
for &ldquo;more&rdquo;&mdash;how he laid it on its back, and laid it on
its side, and laid it on its stomach, and propped it up on
one end in a house made of pillows, and placed the candle
at the foot of the bed, in the vain hope that that
luminary might be graciously deemed by the infant
tyrant a substitute for his individual exertions&mdash;and how,
regardless of all these philanthropic efforts, little Skiddy
stretched out his arms imploringly, and rooted suggestively
at his father&rsquo;s breast, in a way to move a heart of
stone&mdash;and how Mr. Skiddy said several words not to be
found in the catechism&mdash;and how the daylight found him
as pale as a potato sprout in a cellar, with all sorts of
diagonal lines tattoed over his face by enraged little finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
nails&mdash;and how the little horn, that for years had curled
up so gracefully toward his nose, was missing from the
corner of his moustache&mdash;are they not all written in the
ambitious Californian&rsquo;s repentant memory?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;How</span> sweetly they sleep,&rdquo; said Ruth, shading the
small lamp with her hand, and gazing at Katy and
Nettie; &ldquo;God grant <em>their</em> names be not written, widow;&rdquo;
and smoothing back the damp tresses from the brow of
each little sleeper, she sat down to the table, and drawing
from it a piece of fine work, commenced sewing. &ldquo;Only
fifty-cents for all this ruffling and hemming,&rdquo; said Ruth,
as she picked up the wick of her dim lamp; &ldquo;only fifty
cents! and I have labored diligently too, every spare
moment, for a fortnight; this will never do,&rdquo; and she
glanced at the little bed; &ldquo;<em>they</em> must be clothed, and
fed, and educated. Educated?&rdquo; an idea struck Ruth;
&ldquo;why could not she teach school? But who would be
responsible for the rent of her room? There was fuel to
be furnished, and benches; what capital had <em>she</em> to start
with? There was Mrs. Millet, to be sure, and her father,
who, though they were always saying, &lsquo;get something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
do,&rsquo; would never assist her when she tried to do anything;
how easy for them to help her to obtain a few
scholars, or be responsible for her rent, till she could
make a little headway. Ruth resolved, at least, to mention
her project to Mrs. Millet, who could then, if she
felt inclined, have an opportunity to offer her assistance
in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following Monday, when her washing was finished,
Ruth wiped the suds from her parboiled fingers on the
kitchen roller, and ascending the stairs, knocked at the
door of her cousin&rsquo;s chamber. Mrs. Millet was just
putting the finishing touches to the sleeves of a rich silk
dress of Leila&rsquo;s, which the mantau-maker had just returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Ruth,&rdquo; said she, in a tone which implied&mdash;what
on earth do you want now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, with that sudden
sinking at the heart, which even the <em>intonation</em> of a
voice may sometimes give; &ldquo;I can only stay a few minutes;
I stopped to ask you, if you thought there was any
probability of success, should I attempt to get a private
school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to prevent your trying,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Millet, carelessly; &ldquo;other widows have supported
themselves; there was Mrs. Snow.&rdquo; Ruth sighed, for
she knew that Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s relatives had given her letters
of introduction to influential families, and helped her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
various ways till she could get her head above water.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Millet, laying her daughter&rsquo;s silk
dress on the bed, and stepping back a pace or two, with
her head on one side, to mark the effect of the satin bow
she had been arranging; &ldquo;yes&mdash;other widows support
themselves, though, I am sure, I don&rsquo;t know how they do
it&mdash;I suppose there must be a way&mdash;Leila! is that bow
right? seems to me the dress needs a yard or two more
lace; ten dollars will not make much difference; it will
be such an improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Leila, &ldquo;it will be a very great
improvement; and by the way, Ruth, don&rsquo;t you want to
sell me that coral pin you used to wear? it would look
very pretty with this green dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was <em>Harry&rsquo;s</em> gift,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Leila; &ldquo;but I thought you&rsquo;d be very
glad to part with it for <em>money</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flush passed over Ruth&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Not <em>glad</em>, Leila,&rdquo;
she replied, &ldquo;for everything that once belonged to Harry
is precious, though I might feel necessitated to part with
it, in my present circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Millet, touching her daughter&rsquo;s
elbow, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better have it, Leila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry gave ten dollars for it,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>originally</em>, I dare say,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Millet,
&ldquo;but nobody expects to get much for second-hand things.
Leila will give you a dollar and a quarter for it, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
would like it soon, because when this north-east storm
blows over, she wants to make a few calls on Snyder&rsquo;s
relatives, in this very becoming silk dress;&rdquo; and Mrs.
Millet patted Leila on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the brooch,&rdquo; said Leila.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish Ruth would go off into the country, or somewhere,&rdquo;
remarked Leila, as Ruth closed the door. &ldquo;I
have been expecting every day that Snyder would hear
of her offering to make caps in that work-shop; he is
so fastidious about such things, being connected with the
Tidmarshes, and that set, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Leila&rsquo;s elder brother John, a half-fledged
young M.D., whose collegiate and medical education
enabled him one morning to astound the family
breakfast-party with the astute information, &ldquo;that vinegar
was an acid.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I wish she would take herself
off into the country, too. I had as lief see a new doctor&rsquo;s
sign put up next door, as to see her face of a Monday,
over that wash-tub, in our kitchen. I wonder if she
thinks salt an improvement in soap-suds, for the last
time I saw her there she was dropping in the tears on her
clothes, as she scrubbed, at a showering rate; another
thing, mother, I wish you would give her a lesson or two,
about those children of hers. The other day I met her
Katy in the street with the shabbiest old bonnet on, and
the toes of her shoes all rubbed white; and she had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
impertinence to call me &ldquo;<em>cousin</em> John,&rdquo; in the hearing of
young Gerald, who has just returned from abroad, and
who dined with Lord Malden, in Paris. I could have
wrung the little wretch&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>was</em> provoking, John. I&rsquo;ll speak to her about it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Millet, &ldquo;when she brings the coral pin.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ruth</span>, after a sleepless night of reflection upon her
new project, started in the morning in quest of pupils.
She had no permission to refer either to her father,
or to Mrs. Millet; and such being the case, the very fact
of her requesting this favor of any one less nearly related,
would be, of itself, sufficient to cast suspicion upon
her. Some of the ladies upon whom she called were
&ldquo;out,&rdquo; some &ldquo;engaged,&rdquo; some &ldquo;indisposed,&rdquo; and all indifferent;
besides, people are not apt to entrust their
children with a person of whom they know nothing;
Ruth keenly felt this disadvantage.</p>

<p>One lady on whom she called, &ldquo;never sent her children
where the teacher&rsquo;s own children were taught;&rdquo;
another preferred foreign teachers, &ldquo;it was something to
say that Alfred and Alfrida were &lsquo;finished&rsquo; at Signor
Vicchi&rsquo;s establishment;&rdquo; another, after putting Ruth
through the Catechism as to her private history, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
torturing her with the most minute inquiries as to her
past, present, and future, coolly informed her that &ldquo;she
had no children to send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After hours of fruitless searching, Ruth, foot-sore and
heart-sore, returned to her lodgings. That day at dinner,
some one of the boarders spoke of a young girl, who had
been taken to the Hospital in a consumption, contracted
by teaching a Primary School in &mdash;&mdash; street.</p>

<p>The situation was vacant; perhaps she could get it;
certainly her education <em>ought</em> to qualify her to satisfy any
&ldquo;School Committee.&rdquo; Ruth inquired who they were; one
was her cousin, Mr. Millet, the wooden man; one was
Mr. Develin, the literary bookseller; the two others
were strangers. Mr. Millet and Mr. Develin! and both
aware how earnestly she longed for employment! Ruth
looked at her children; yes, for their sake she would
even go to the wooden man, and Mr. Develin, and ask if
it were not possible for her to obtain the vacant Primary
School.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Millet</span> sat in his counting room, with his pen
behind his ear, examining his ledger. &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; said
he concisely, by way of salutation, as Ruth entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand there is a vacancy in the 5th Ward Primary
School,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;can you tell me, as you are
one of the Committee for that district, if there is any
prospect of my obtaining it, and how I shall manage to
do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Apply">A-p-p-l-y</strong>,&rdquo; said Mr. Millet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is the examination of applicants to take

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="City Hall">C-i-t-y&mdash;H-a-l-l</strong>,&rdquo; responded the wooden man, making
an entry in his ledger.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s heroic resolutions to ask him to use his influence
in her behalf, vanished into thin air, at this icy reserve;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and, passing out into the street, she bent her slow
steps in the direction of Mr. Develin&rsquo;s. On entering the
door, she espied that gentleman through the glass door
of his counting-room, sitting in his leathern arm-chair,
with his hands folded, in an attitude of repose and meditation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I speak to you a moment?&rdquo; said Ruth, lifting
the latch of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; replied Mr. Develin,
seizing a package of letters; &ldquo;it is an uncommon
busy time with me, but yes, certainly, if you have anything
<em>particular</em> to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth mentioned in as few words as possible, the Primary
School, and her hopes of obtaining it, Mr. Develin,
meanwhile, opening the letters and perusing their
contents. When she had finished, he said, taking his hat
to go out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;ll stand as good a chance, Mrs.
Hall, as anybody else; you can apply. But you must
excuse me, for I have an invoice of books to look over,
immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Ruth! And this was human nature, which, for
so many sunny years of prosperity, had turned to her
only its <em>bright</em> side! She was not to be discouraged,
however, and sent in her application.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Examination</span> day came, and Ruth bent her determined
steps to the City Hall. The apartment designated
was already crowded with waiting applicants, who
regarded, with jealous eye, each addition to their number
as so much dimunition of their own individual
chance for success.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s cheeks grew hot, as their scrutinizing and unfriendly
glances were bent on her, and that feeling of utter
desolation came over her, which was always so overwhelming
whenever she presented herself as a suppliant
for public favor. In truth, it was but a poor preparation
for the inquisitorial torture before her.</p>

<p>The applicants were called out, one by one, in alphabetical
order; Ruth inwardly blessing the early nativity
of the letter H, for these anticipatory-shower-bath meditations
were worse to her than the shock of a volley of
chilling interrogations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letter H.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth rose with a flutter at her heart, and entered a
huge, barren-looking room, at the further end of which
sat, in august state, the dread committee. <em>Very</em> respectable
were the gentlemen of whom that committee was
composed; <em>respectable</em> was written all over them, from
the crowns of their scholastic heads to the very tips of
their polished boots; and correct and methodical as a
revised dictionary they sat, with folded hands and spectacle-bestridden
noses.</p>

<p>Ruth seated herself in the victim&rsquo;s chair, before this
august body, facing a flood of light from a large bay-window,
that nearly extinguished her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your age?&rdquo; asked the elder of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>Scratch went the extorted secret on the nib of the
reporter&rsquo;s pen!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was you educated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Colburn, or Emerson, your teacher&rsquo;s standard
for Arithmetic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you cipher on a slate, or black-board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you learn the multiplication table, skipping, or
in order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was you taught Astronomy, or Philosophy, first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you accustomed to a quill, or a steel-pen? lines,
or blank-paper, in writing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you use Smith&rsquo;s, or Jones&rsquo; Writing-Book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you learn Geography by Maps, or Globes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Globes?&rdquo; asked Mr. Squizzle, repeating Ruth&rsquo;s answer;
&ldquo;possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They use Globes at the celebrated Jerrold Institute,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Fizzle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Squizzle, growing plethoric
in the face; &ldquo;Globes, sir, are exploded; no institution
of any note uses Globes, sir. I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I know you labor under a mistake,&rdquo; said Fizzle,
elevating his chin, and folding his arms pugnaciously
over his striped vest. &ldquo;I am acquainted with one of the
teachers in that highly-respectable school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, sir,&rdquo; said Squizzle, &ldquo;am well acquainted with
the Principal, who is a man of too much science, sir, to
use globes, sir, to teach geography, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, Mr. Fizzle settled down behind his dicky with
a quenched air; and the very important question being
laid on the shelf, Mr. Squizzle, handing Ruth a copy of
&ldquo;Pollock&rsquo;s Course of Time,&rdquo; requested her to read a
marked passage, indicated by a perforation of his pen-knife.
Poor Ruth stood about as fair a chance of proving
her ability to read poetry, as would Fanny Kemble
to take up a play, hap-hazard, at one of her dramatic
readings, without a previous opportunity to gather up the
author&rsquo;s connecting thread. Our heroine, however, went
through the motions. This farce concluded, Ruth was dismissed
into the apartment in waiting, to make room for
the other applicants, each of whom returned with red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
faces, moist foreheads, and a &ldquo;Carry-me-back-to-Old-Virginia&rdquo;
air.</p>

<p>An hour&rsquo;s added suspense, and the four owners of
the four pair of inquisitorial spectacles marched, in
procession, into the room in waiting, and wheeling &ldquo;face
about,&rdquo; with military precision, thumped on the table,
and ejaculated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantaneously, five-and-twenty pair of eyes, black,
blue, brown, and gray, were riveted; and each owner
being supplied with pen, ink, and paper, was allowed ten
minutes (with the four-pair of spectacles levelled full at
her) to express her thoughts on the following subject:
&ldquo;Was Christopher Columbus standing up, or sitting
down, when he discovered America?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four watches of the committee men being drawn
out, pencils began to scratch; and the terminus of the allotted
minutes, in the middle of a sentence, was the place
for each inspired improvisatrice to stop.</p>

<p>These hasty effusions being endorsed by appending
each writer&rsquo;s signature, new paper was furnished, and
&ldquo;<strong title="Attention">A-t-t-e-n-t-i-o-n</strong>!&rdquo; was again ejaculated by a short, pursy
individual, who seemed to be struggling to get out of his
coat by climbing over his shirt collar. Little armies of
figures were then rattled off from the end of this gentleman&rsquo;s
tongue, with &ldquo;Peter Piper Pipkin&rdquo; velocity, which
the anxious pen-women in waiting were expected to arrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in flying, and have the &ldquo;sum total of the hull,&rdquo; as one
of the erudite committee observed, already added up, when
the illustrious arithmetician stopped to take wind.</p>

<p>This being the finale, the ladies were sapiently informed
that, as only <em>one</em> school mistress was needed,
only <em>one</em> out of the large number of applicants could be
elected, and that &ldquo;the Committee would now sit on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this gratifying intelligence, the ladies, favored by a
plentiful shower of rain, betook themselves to their respective
homes; four-and-twenty, God help them! to
dream of a reprieve from starvation, which, notwithstanding
the six-hours&rsquo; purgatory they had passed through,
was destined to elude their eager grasp.</p>

<p>The votes were cast. Ruth was <em>not</em> elected. She had
been educated, (whether fortunately or unfortunately, let
the sequel of my story decide,) at a school where &ldquo;Webster&rdquo;
was used instead of &ldquo;Worcester.&rdquo; The greatest
gun on the Committee was a Worcesterite. Mr. Millet
and Mr. Develin always followed in the wake of <em>great</em>
guns. Mr. Millet and Mr. Develin voted <em>against</em> Ruth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and very tranquil
and quiet at the Skiddy&rsquo;s. A tidy, rosy-cheeked
young woman sat rocking the deserted little Tommy to
sleep, to the tune of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been roaming.&rdquo; The hearth
was neatly swept, the tin and pewter vessels hung,
brightly polished, from their respective shelves. The
Maltese cat lay winking in the middle of the floor, watching
the play of a stray sunbeam, which had found its
way over the shed and into the small window. Ruth
and her children were quiet, as usual, in their gloomy
back chamber. Mr. Skiddy, a few blocks off, sat perched
on a high stool, in the counting-room of Messrs. Fogg
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>Noiselessly the front-door opened, and the veritable
Mrs. Skiddy, followed by Johnny and Sammy, crept
through the front entry and entered, unannounced, into
the kitchen. The rosy-cheeked young woman looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Mrs. Skiddy, Mrs. Skiddy looked at her, and Tommy
looked at both of them. Mrs. Skiddy then boxed the
rosy-cheeked young woman&rsquo;s ears, and snatching the bewildered
baby from her grasp, ejected her, with lightning
velocity, through the street-door, and turned the key. It
was all the work of an instant. Sammy and Johnny
were used to domestic whirlwinds, so they were not surprised
into any little remarks or exclamations, but the
cat, less philosophical, laid back her ears, and made
for the ash-hole; while Mrs. Skiddy, seating herself in
the rocking-chair, unhooked her traveling dress and reinstated
the delighted Tommy into all his little infantile
privileges.</p>

<p>Mr. Skiddy had now been a whole week a widower;
time enough for a man in that condition to grow philosophical.
In fact, Skiddy was content. He had tasted
the sweets of liberty, and he liked them. The baby, poor
little soul, tired of remonstrance, had given out from
sheer weariness, and took resignedly as a little christian
to his pewter porringer. Yes, Skiddy liked it; he could
be an hour behind his time without dodging, on his return,
a rattling storm of abuse and crockery; he could
spend an evening out, without drawing a map of his
travels before starting. On the afternoon in question he
felt particularly felicitous; first, because he had dined off
fried liver and potatoes, a dish which he particularly affected,
and which, on that very account, he could seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
get in his own domicil; secondly, he was engaged to go
that very evening with his old love, Nancy Spriggins, to
see the &ldquo;Panorama of Niagara;&rdquo; and he had left orders
with Betty to have tea half an hour earlier in consequence,
and to be sure and iron and air his killing plaid
vest by seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>As the afternoon waned, Skiddy grew restless; he
made wrong entries in the ledger; dipped his pen into
the sand-box instead of the inkstand, and several times
said &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; to his employer, Mr. Fogg, of Fogg
Square.</p>

<p>Six o&rsquo;clock came at last, and the emancipated Skiddy,
turning his back on business, walked towards home, in
peace with himself, and in love with Nancy Spriggins.
On the way he stopped to purchase a bouquet of roses
and geraniums with which to regale that damsel&rsquo;s olfactories
during the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>

<p>Striding through the front entry, like a man who felt
himself to be master of his own house, Skiddy hastened
to the kitchen to expedite tea. If he was not prepared
for Mrs. Skiddy&rsquo;s departure, still less was he prepared
for her return, especially with that tell-tale bouquet in
his hand. But, like all other hen-pecked husbands, on the
back of the scape-goat <em>Cunning</em>, he fled away from the
uplifted lash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>dear</em> Matilda,&rdquo; exclaimed Skiddy, &ldquo;my own
wife, how <em>could</em> you be so cruel? Every day since your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
departure, hoping to find you here on my return from
the store, I have purchased a bouquet like this to present
you. My dear wife, let by-gones <em>be</em> by-gones; my
love for you is imperishable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Very">V-e-r-y</strong> good, Mr. Skiddy,&rdquo; said his wife, accepting
Nancy Spriggins&rsquo;s bouquet, with a queenly nod; &ldquo;and now
let us have no more talk of <em>California</em>, if you please, Mr.
Skiddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, my darling; I was a brute, a beast, a
wretch, a Hottentot, a cannibal, a vampire&mdash;to distress
you so. Dear little Tommy! how pleasant it seems to
see him in your arms again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Skiddy, &ldquo;I was not five minutes
in sending that red-faced German girl spinning through
the front-door; I hope you have something decent for us
to eat, Skiddy. Johnny and Sammy are pretty sharp-set;
why don&rsquo;t you come and speak to your father,
boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young gentlemen thus summoned, slowly came
forward, looking altogether undecided whether it was
best to notice their father or not. A ginger-cake, however,
and a slice of buttered bread, plentifully powdered
with sugar, wonderfully assisted them in coming to a decision.
As to Nancy Spriggins, poor soul, she pulled off
her gloves, and pulled them on, that evening, and looked
at her watch, and looked up street and down street, and
declared, as &ldquo;the clock told the hour for retiring,&rdquo; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
man was a &mdash;&mdash;, a &mdash;&mdash;, in short, that woman was born
to trouble, as the sparks are&mdash;to fly away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Skiddy resumed her household duties with as
much coolness as if there had been no interregnum, and
received the boarders at tea that night, just as if she had
parted with them that day at dinner. Skiddy was apparently
as devoted as ever; the uninitiated boarders
opened their eyes in bewildered wonder; and <em>triumph</em>
sat inscribed on the arch of Mrs. Skiddy&rsquo;s imposing Roman
nose.</p>

<p>The domestic horizon still continued cloudless at the
next morning&rsquo;s breakfast. After the boarders had left
the table, the market prices of beef, veal, pork, cutlets,
chops, and steaks, were discussed as usual, the bill of
fare for the day was drawn up by Mrs. Skiddy, and her
obedient spouse departed to execute her market orders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, I hope you have been comfortable in my absence,
Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Skiddy, after despatching
her husband to market, as she seated herself in
the chair nearest the door; &ldquo;ha! ha! John and I may
call it quits now. He is a very good fellow&mdash;John; except
these little tantrums he gets into once in a while;
the only way is, to put a stop to it at once, and let him
see who is master. John never will set a river on fire;
there&rsquo;s no sort of use in his trying to take the reins&mdash;the
man wasn&rsquo;t born for it. I&rsquo;m too sharp for him, that&rsquo;s a
fact. Ha! ha! poor Johnny! I <em>must</em> tell you what a
trick I played him about two years after our marriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know he had to go away on business for
Fogg &amp; Co., to collect bills, or something of that sort.
Well, he made a great fuss about it, as husbands who
like to go away from home always do; and said he
should &lsquo;pine for the sight of me, and never know a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
happy hour till he saw me again,&rsquo; and all that; and
finally declared he would not go, without I would let him
take my Daguerreotype. Of course, I knew that was all
humbug; but I consented. The likeness was pronounced
&lsquo;good,&rsquo; and placed <em>by me</em> in his travelling trunk, when I
packed his clothes. Well, he was gone a month, and
when he came back, he told me (great fool) what a comfort
my Daguerreotype was to him, and how he had
looked at it twenty times a day, and kissed it as many
more; whereupon I went to his trunk, and opening it,
took out the case and showed it to him&mdash;<em>without the plate</em>,
which I had taken care to slip out of the frame just
before he started, and which he had never found out!
That&rsquo;s a specimen of John Skiddy!&mdash;and John Skiddy
is a fair specimen of the rest of his sex, let me tell you,
Mrs. Hall. Well, of course he looked sheepish enough;
and now, whenever I want to take the nonsense out of
him, all I have to do is to point to that Daguerreotype
case, which I keep lying on the mantel on purpose.
When a woman is married, Mrs. Hall, she must make
up her mind either to manage, or to be managed; <em>I</em> prefer
to manage,&rdquo; said the amiable Mrs. Skiddy; &ldquo;and I
flatter myself John understands it by this time. But,
dear me, I can&rsquo;t stand here prating to you all day. I
must look round and see what mischief has been done in
my absence, by that lazy-looking red-faced German girl,&rdquo;
and Mrs. Skiddy laughed heartily, as she related how she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had sent her spinning through the front door the night
before.</p>

<p>Half the forenoon was occupied by Mrs. Skiddy in
counting up spoons, forks, towels, and baby&rsquo;s pinafores,
to see if they had sustained loss or damage during her absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very odd dinner don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said she, consulting the
kitchen clock; &ldquo;it is high time that beef was on, roasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> odd&mdash;and odder still that Skiddy had not appeared
to tell her <em>why</em> the dinner didn&rsquo;t come. Mrs.
Skiddy wasted no time in words about it. No; she seized
her bonnet, and went immediately to Fogg &amp; Co., to
get some tidings of him; they were apparently quite as
much at a loss as herself to account for Skiddy&rsquo;s non-appearance.
She was just departing, when one of the sub-clerks,
whom the unfortunate Skiddy had once snubbed,
whispered a word in her ear, the effect of which was instantaneous.
Did she let the grass grow under her feet
till she tracked Skiddy to &ldquo;the wharf,&rdquo; and boarded the
&ldquo;Sea-Gull,&rdquo; bound for California, and brought the crestfallen
man triumphantly back to his domicil, amid convulsions
of laughter from the amused captain and his
crew? No.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said his amiable spouse, untying her
bonnet, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s <em>another</em> flash in the pan, Skiddy. Anybody
who thinks to circumvent Matilda Maria Skiddy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
must get up early in the morning, and find themselves
too late at that. Now hold this child,&rdquo; dumping the
doomed baby into his lap, &ldquo;while I comb my hair.
Goodness knows you weren&rsquo;t worth bringing back; but
when I set out to have my own way, Mr. Skiddy, Mount
Vesuvius shan&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skiddy tended the baby without a remonstrance; he
perfectly understood, that for a probationary time he
should be put &ldquo;on the limits,&rdquo; the street-door being the
boundary line. He heaved no sigh when his coat and
hat, with the rest of his wearing apparel, were locked up,
and the key buried in the depths of his wife&rsquo;s pocket.
He played with Tommy, and made card-houses for
Sammy and Johnny, wound several tangled skeins of silk
for &ldquo;Maria Matilda,&rdquo; mended a broken button on the
closet door, replaced a missing knob on one of the
bureau drawers, and appeared to be in as resigned and
proper a frame of mind as such a perfidious wretch could
be expected to be in.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks passed in this state of incarceration,
during which the errand-boy of Fogg &amp; Co. had
been repeatedly informed by Mrs. Skiddy, that the doctor
hoped Mr. Skiddy would soon be sufficiently convalescent
to attend to business. As to Skiddy, he continued
at intervals to shed crocodile tears over his past short-comings,
or rather his short-<em>goings</em>! In consequence of
this apparently submissive frame of mind, he, one fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
morning, received total absolution from Mrs. Skiddy, and
leave to go to the store; which Skiddy peremptorily declined,
desiring, as he said, to test the sincerity of his repentance
by a still longer period of probation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Skiddy,&rdquo; said Maria Matilda, pointing
to the Daguerreotype case, and then crowding his
beaver down over his eyes; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool. Make a
B line for the store, now, and tell Fogg you&rsquo;ve had an
attack of <em>room-a-tism</em>;&rdquo; and Maria Matilda laughed at her
wretched pun.</p>

<p>Skiddy obeyed. No Uriah Heep could have out-done
him in &ldquo;&rsquo;umbleness,&rdquo; as he crept up the long street, until
a friendly corner hid him from the lynx eyes of Maria
Matilda. Then &ldquo;Richard was himself again&rdquo;! Drawing
a long breath, our flying Mercury whizzed past the
mile-stones, and, before sun-down of the same day, was
under full sail for California.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just one half hour our Napoleon in petticoats spent in
reflection, after being satisfied that Skiddy was really &ldquo;on
the deep blue sea.&rdquo; In one day she had cleared her
house of <em>boarders</em>, and reserving one room for herself
and children, filled all the other apartments with <em>lodgers</em>;
who paid her good prices, and taking their meals
down town, made her no trouble beyond the care of their
respective rooms.</p>

<p>About a year after a letter came from Skiddy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was &ldquo;disgusted&rdquo; with ill-luck at gold-digging, and ill-luck
everywhere else; he had been &ldquo;burnt out,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;robbed,&rdquo; and everything else but murdered; and
&ldquo;&rsquo;umbly&rdquo; requested his dear Maria Matilda to send him
the &ldquo;passage-money to return home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Skiddy&rsquo;s picture should have been taken at that
moment! My pen fails! Drawing from her pocket a
purse well filled with her own honest earnings, she
chinked its contents at some phantom shape discernible to
her eyes alone; while through her set teeth hissed out,
like ten thousand serpents, the word</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Never">N&mdash;e&mdash;v&mdash;e&mdash;r</strong>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;What</span> is it on the gate? Spell it, mother,&rdquo; said
Katy, looking wistfully through the iron fence at
the terraced banks, smoothly-rolled gravel walks, plats of
flowers, and grape-trellised arbors; &ldquo;what is it on the
gate, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Insane Hospital,&rsquo; dear; a place for crazy people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to walk round, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked the gate-keeper,
as Katy poked her little head in; &ldquo;can, if you like.&rdquo;
Little Katy&rsquo;s eyes pleaded eloquently; flowers were to
her another name for happiness, and Ruth passed in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to live here, mamma,&rdquo; said Katy.</p>

<p>Ruth shuddered, and pointed to a pale face pressed
close against the grated window. Fair rose the building
in its architectural proportions; the well-kept lawn was
beautiful to the eye; but, alas! there was helpless age,
whose only disease was too long a lease of life for greedy
heirs. There, too, was the fragile wife, to whom <em>love</em> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
breath&mdash;being!&mdash;forgotten by the world and him in
whose service her bloom had withered, insane&mdash;only in
that her love had outlived his patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor creatures!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, as they peered
out from one window after another. &ldquo;Have you had
many deaths here?&rdquo; asked she of the gate-keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some, ma&rsquo;am. There is one corpse in the house
now; a married lady, Mrs. Leon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, &ldquo;my friend Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Died yesterday, ma&rsquo;am; her husband left her here for
her health, while he went to Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see the Superintendent,&rdquo; asked Ruth; &ldquo;I must
speak to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth followed the gate-keeper up the ample steps into
a wide hall, and from thence into a small parlor; after
waiting what seemed to her an age of time, Mr. Tibbetts,
the Superintendent, entered. He was a tall, handsome
man, between forty and fifty, with a very imposing air
and address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pained to learn,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;that a friend of
mine, Mrs. Leon, lies dead here; can I see the body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a relative of that lady?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tibbetts,
with a keen glance at Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;but she was very dear to me.
The last time I saw her, not many months since, she
was in tolerable health. Has she been long with you,
Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;About two months,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tibbetts; &ldquo;she was
hopelessly crazy, refused food entirely, so that we were
obliged to force it. Her husband, who is an intimate
friend of mine, left her under my care, and went to the
Continent. A very fine man, Mr. Leon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth did not feel inclined to respond to this remark,
but repeated her request to see Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is against the rules of our establishment to permit
this to any but relatives,&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should esteem it a great favor if you would break
through your rules in my case,&rdquo; replied Ruth; &ldquo;it will be
a great consolation to me to have seen her once more;&rdquo;
and her voice faltered.</p>

<p>The appeal was made so gently, yet so firmly, that
Mr. Tibbetts reluctantly yielded.</p>

<p>The matron of the establishment, Mrs. Bunce, (whose
advent was heralded by the clinking of a huge bunch of
keys at her waist,) soon after came in. Mrs. Bunce was
gaunt, sallow and bony, with restless, yellowish, glaring
black eyes, very much resembling those of a cat in the
dark; her motions were quick, brisk, and angular; her
voice loud, harsh, and wiry. Ruth felt an instantaneous
aversion to her; which was not lessened by Mrs. Bunce
asking, as they passed through the parlor-door:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fond of looking at corpses, ma&rsquo;am? I&rsquo;ve seen a
great many in my day; I&rsquo;ve laid out more&rsquo;n twenty people,
first and last, with my own hands. Relation of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Leon&rsquo;s, perhaps?&rdquo; said she, curiously peering under
Ruth&rsquo;s bonnet. &ldquo;Ah, only a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, if you please, ma&rsquo;am;&rdquo; and on they went,
through one corridor, then another, the massive doors
swinging heavily to on their hinges, and fastening behind
them as they closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Ruth, with a quick, terrified look,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; replied the matron, &ldquo;only a crazy
woman in that room yonder, screaming for her child.
Her husband ran away from her and carried off her child
with him, to spite her, and now she fancies every footstep
she hears is his. Visitors always thinks she screams
awful. She can&rsquo;t harm you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the matron,
mistaking the cause of Ruth&rsquo;s shudder, &ldquo;for she is
chained. She went to law about the child, and the law,
you see, as it generally is, was on the man&rsquo;s side; and it
just upset her. She&rsquo;s a sight of trouble to manage. If
she was to catch sight of your little girl out there in the
garden, she&rsquo;d spring at her through them bars like a
panther; but we don&rsquo;t have to whip her <em>very</em> often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down here,&rdquo; said the matron, taking the shuddering
Ruth by the hand, and descending a flight of stone steps,
into a dark passage-way. &ldquo;Tired arn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, please,&rdquo; said Ruth, leaning against the
stone wall, for her limbs were trembling so violently that
she could scarcely bear her weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Now</em>,&rdquo; said she, (after a pause,) with a firmer voice
and step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bunce, advancing towards a
rough deal box which stood on a table in a niche of the
cellar, and setting a small lamp upon it; &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t
look no better than that, ma&rsquo;am, for a long while before
she died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth gave one hurried glance at the corpse, and buried
her face in her hands. Well might she fail to recognize
in that emaciated form, those sunken eyes and hollow
cheeks, the beautiful Mary Leon. Well might she shudder,
as the gibbering screams of the maniacs over head
echoed through the stillness of that cold, gloomy vault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you with her at the last?&rdquo; asked Ruth of the
matron, wiping away her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;the afternoon she died she said,
&lsquo;I want to be alone,&rsquo; and, not thinking her near her end,
I took my work and sat just outside the door. I looked
in once, about half an hour after, but she lay quietly
asleep, with her cheek in her hand,&mdash;so. By-and-bye I
thought I would speak to her, so I went in, and saw her
lying just as she did when I looked at her before. I spoke
to her, but she did not answer me; she was dead, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O, how mournfully sounded in Ruth&rsquo;s ears those plaintive
words, &ldquo;I want to be alone.&rdquo; Poor Mary! aye, better
even in death &lsquo;alone,&rsquo; than gazed at by careless, hireling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
eyes, since he who should have closed those drooping
lids, had wearied of their faded light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she speak of no one?&rdquo; asked Ruth; &ldquo;mention
no one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes; I recollect now that she said something
about calling Ruth; I didn&rsquo;t pay any attention, for
they don&rsquo;t know what they are saying, you know. She
scribbled something, too, on a bit of paper; I found it
under her pillow, when I laid her out. I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if it was in my pocket now; I haven&rsquo;t thought of
it since. Ah! here it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bunce, as she handed
the slip of paper to Ruth.</p>

<p>It ran thus:&mdash;&ldquo;I am not crazy, Ruth, no, no&mdash;but I
shall be; the air of this place stifles me; I grow weaker&mdash;weaker.
I cannot die here; for the love of heaven, dear
Ruth, come and take me away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only three mourners,&mdash;a woman and two little girls,&rdquo;
exclaimed a by-stander, as Ruth followed Mary Leon to
her long home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> sudden change in Mrs. Skiddy&rsquo;s matrimonial
prospects necessitated Ruth to seek other quarters.
With a view to still more rigid economy, she hired a
room without board, in the lower part of the city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters, her new landlady, was one of that description
of females, whose vision is bounded by a mop,
scrubbing-brush, and dust-pan; who repudiate rainy washing
days; whose hearth, Jowler, on the stormiest night,
would never venture near without a special permit, and
whose husband and children speak under their breath on
baking and cleaning days. Mrs. Waters styled herself a
female physician. She kept a sort of witch&rsquo;s cauldron constantly
boiling over the fire, in which seethed all sorts of
&ldquo;mints&rdquo; and &ldquo;yarbs,&rdquo; and from which issued what she
called a &ldquo;potecary odor.&rdquo; Mrs. Waters, when not engaged
in stirring this cauldron, or in her various house-keeping
duties, alternated her leisure in reading medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
books, attending medical lectures, and fondling a pet
skull, which lay on the kitchen-dresser.</p>

<p>Various little boxes of brown-bread-looking pills ornamented
the upper shelf, beside a row of little dropsical
chunky junk bottles, whose labels would have puzzled
the most erudite M.&nbsp;D. who ever received a diploma.
Mrs. Waters felicitated herself on knowing how the
outer and inner man of every son of Adam was put
together, and considered the times decidedly &ldquo;out of
joint;&rdquo; inasmuch that she, Mrs. Waters, had not been
called upon by her country to fill some medical professorship.</p>

<p>In person Mrs. Waters was barber-pole-ish and ram-rod-y,
and her taste in dress running mostly to
stringy fabrics, assisted the bolster-y impression she
created; her hands and wrists bore a strong resemblance
to the yellow claws of defunct chickens, which children
play &ldquo;scare&rdquo; with about Thanksgiving time; her feet
were of turtle flatness, and her eyes&mdash;if you ever provoked
a cat up to the bristling and scratching point, you
may possibly form an idea of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters condescended to allow Ruth to keep the
quart of milk and loaf of bread, (which was to serve for
her bill of fare for every day&rsquo;s three meals,) on a swing
shelf in a corner of the cellar. As Ruth&rsquo;s room was at
the top of the house, it was somewhat of a journey to
travel up and down, and the weather was too warm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
keep it up stairs; to her dismay she soon found that the
cellar-floor was generally more or less flooded with water,
and the sudden change from the heated air of her
attic to the dampness of the cellar, brought on a racking
cough, which soon told upon her health. Upon the first
symptom of it, Mrs. Waters seized a box of pills and
hurried to her room, assuring her that it was &ldquo;a sure
cure, and only three shillings a box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;but it is my rule never to
take medicine unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Waters, bridling up; &ldquo;I see&mdash;unless
it is ordered by a physician, you were going to say;
perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that <em>I</em> am a physician&mdash;none the
worse for being a female. I have investigated things; I
have dissected several cats, and sent in an analysis of them
to the Medical Journal; it has never been published, owing,
probably, to the editor being out of town. If you will
take six of these pills every other night,&rdquo; said the doctress,
laying the box on the table, &ldquo;it will cure your
cough; it is only three shillings. I will take the money
now, or charge it in your bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three shillings!&rdquo; Ruth was aghast; she might as
well have asked her three dollars. If there was anything
Ruth was afraid of, it was Mrs. Waters&rsquo; style of woman;
a loaded cannon, or a regiment of dragoons, would have
had few terrors in comparison. But the music must be
faced; so, hoping to avoid treading on her landlady&rsquo;s professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
toes, Ruth said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try first what dieting
will do, Mrs. Waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door instantly banged to with a crash, as the
owner and vender of the pills passed out. The next
day Mrs. Waters drew off a little superfluous feminine
bile, by announcing to Ruth, with a malignity worthy of
her sex, &ldquo;that she forgot to mention when she let her
lodgings, that she should expect her to scour the stairs
she traveled over, at least once a week.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was a sultry morning in July. Ruth had risen early,
for her cough seemed more troublesome in a reclining
posture. &ldquo;I wonder what that noise can be?&rdquo; said she to
herself; whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir, it went, all day long in the
attic overhead. She knew that Mrs. Waters had one other
lodger beside herself, an elderly gentleman by the name
of Bond, who cooked his own food, and whom she often
met on the stairs, coming up with a pitcher of water, or
a few eggs in a paper bag, or a pie that he had bought of
Mr. Flake, at the little black grocery-shop at the corner.
On these occasions he always stepped aside, and with a
deferential bow waited for Ruth to pass. He was a thin,
spare man, slightly bent; his hair and whiskers curiously
striped like a zebra, one lock being jet black, while the
neighboring one was as distinct a white. His dress
was plain, but very neat and tidy. He never seemed to
have any business out-doors, as he stayed in his room all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
day, never leaving it at all till dark, when he paced up
and down, with his hands behind him, before the house.
&ldquo;Whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir.&rdquo; It was early sunrise; but
Ruth had heard that odd noise for two hours at least.
What <em>could</em> it mean? Just then a carrier passed on the
other side of the street with the morning papers, and
slipped one under the crack of the house door opposite.</p>

<p>A thought! why could not Ruth write for the papers?
How very odd it had never occurred to her before? Yes,
write for the papers&mdash;why not? She remembered that
while at boarding-school, an editor of a paper in the same
town used often to come in and take down her compositions
in short-hand as she read them aloud, and transfer
them to the columns of his paper. She certainly
<em>ought</em> to write better now than she did when an inexperienced
girl. She would begin that very night; but where
to make a beginning? who would publish her articles?
how much would they pay her? to whom should she
apply first? There was her brother Hyacinth, now the
prosperous editor of the Irving Magazine; oh, if he would
only employ her? Ruth was quite sure she could write
as well as some of his correspondents, whom he had
praised with no niggardly pen. She would prepare samples
to send immediately, announcing her intention, and
offering them for his acceptance. This means of support
would be so congenial, so absorbing. At the needle one&rsquo;s
mind could still be brooding over sorrowful thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth counted the days and hours impatiently, as she
waited for an answer. Hyacinth surely would not refuse
<em>her</em> when in almost every number of his magazine he was
announcing some new contributor; or, if <em>he</em> could not
employ her <em>himself</em>, he surely would be brotherly enough
to point out to her some one of the many avenues so accessible
to a man of extensive newspaperial and literary
acquaintance. She would so gladly support herself, so
cheerfully toil day and night, if need be, could she only
win an independence; and Ruth recalled with a sigh
Katy&rsquo;s last visit to her father, and then she rose and
walked the floor in her impatience; and then, her restless
spirit urging her on to her fate, she went again to the
post office to see if there were no letter. How long the
clerk made her wait! Yes, there <em>was</em> a letter for her, and
in her brother&rsquo;s hand-writing too. Oh, how long since she
had seen it!</p>

<p>Ruth heeded neither the jostling of office-boys, porters,
or draymen, as she held out her eager hand for the letter.
Thrusting it hastily in her pocket, she hurried in breathless
haste back to her lodgings. The contents were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I have looked over the pieces you sent me, Ruth. It
is very evident that writing never can be <em>your</em> forte; you
have no talent that way. You may possibly be employed
by some inferior newspapers, but be assured your articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
never will be heard of out of your own little provincial
city. For myself I have plenty of contributors, nor do
I know of any of my literary acquaintances who would
employ you. I would advise you, therefore, to seek
some <em>unobtrusive</em> employment. Your brother,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Hyacinth Ellet.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A bitter smile struggled with the hot tear that fell
upon Ruth&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I have tried the unobtrusive employment,&rdquo;
said Ruth; &ldquo;the wages are six cents a day,
Hyacinth;&rdquo; and again the bitter smile disfigured her gentle
lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No talent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At another tribunal than his will I appeal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never be heard of out of my own little provincial city!&rdquo;
The cold, contemptuous tone stung her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they shall be heard of;&rdquo; and Ruth leaped to
her feet. &ldquo;Sooner than he dreams of, too. I <em>can</em> do
it, I <em>feel</em> it, I <em>will</em> do it,&rdquo; and she closed her lips
firmly; &ldquo;but there will be a desperate struggle first,&rdquo;
and she clasped her hands over her heart as if it
had already commenced; &ldquo;there will be scant meals,
and sleepless nights, and weary days, and a throbbing
brow, and an aching heart; there will be the chilling
tone, the rude repulse; there will be ten backward steps
to one forward. <em>Pride</em> must sleep! but&mdash;&rdquo; and Ruth
glanced at her children&mdash;&ldquo;it shall be <em>done</em>. They shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
be proud of their mother. <em>Hyacinth shall yet be proud
to claim his sister.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mamma?&rdquo; asked Katy, looking wonderingly
at the strange expression of her mother&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, my darling?&rdquo; and Ruth caught up the
child with convulsive energy; &ldquo;what is it? only that
when you are a woman you shall remember this day, my
little pet;&rdquo; and as she kissed Katy&rsquo;s upturned brow a
bright spot burned on her cheek, and her eye glowed like
a star.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Doctor?</span>&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall, &ldquo;put down that book,
will you? I want to talk to you a bit; there
you&rsquo;ve sat these three hours, without stirring, except to
brush the flies off your nose, and my tongue actually
aches keeping still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh-sh-sh,&rdquo; said the doctor, running his forefinger
along to guide his purblind eyes safely to the end of the
paragraph. &ldquo;Sh-sh. &lsquo;It&mdash;is es-ti-ma-ted by Captain Smith&mdash;that&mdash;there&mdash;are&mdash;up&rsquo;ards&mdash;of&mdash;ten&mdash;hundred&mdash;human&mdash;critters&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;Nor-West&mdash;sett-le-ment.&rsquo;
Well&mdash;Mis.
Hall&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; said the doctor, laying a faded ribbon
mark between the leaves of the book, and pushing
his spectacles back on his forehead, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to pay now?
what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind as ever I had to eat,&rdquo; said the old
lady, pettishly, &ldquo;to knit twice round the heel of this
stocking, before I answer you; what do you think I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
about Captain Smith? Travelers always lie; it is a part
of their trade, and if they don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s neither here nor there
to me. I wish that book was in the Red Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t want it <em>read</em>,&rdquo; retorted the irritating
old doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I suppose you call that funny,&rdquo; said the old
lady. &ldquo;I call it simply ridiculous for a man of your
years to play on words in such a frivolous manner.
What I was going to say was this, <abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr> if I can get a
chance to say it, if <em>you</em> have given up all idea of getting
Harry&rsquo;s children, <em>I</em> haven&rsquo;t, and now is the time to apply
for Katy again; for, according to all accounts, Ruth
is getting along poorly enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you hear?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my milliner, Miss Tiffkins, has a nephew who
tends in a little grocery-shop near where Ruth boards,
and he says that she buys a smaller loaf every time she
comes to the store, and that the milkman told him that
she only took a pint of milk a day of him now; then
Katy has not been well, and what she did for doctors and
medicines is best known to herself; she&rsquo;s so independent
that she never would complain if she had to eat paving
stones. The best way to get the child will be to ask her
here on a visit, and say we want to cure her up a little
with country air. You understand? that will throw dust
in Ruth&rsquo;s eyes, and then we will take our own time about
letting her go back you know. Miss Tiffkins says her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
nephew says that people who come into the grocery-shop
are very curious to know who Ruth is; and old Mr.
Flake, who keeps it, says that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her any, if
she is a lady, to stop and talk a little, like the rest of his
customers; he says, too, that her children are as close-mouthed
as their mother, for when he just asked Katy
what business her father used to do, and what supported
them now he was dead, and if they lived all the time on
bread and milk, and a few such little questions, Katy
answered, &lsquo;Mamma does not allow me to talk to strangers,&rsquo;
and went out of the shop, with her loaf of bread,
as dignified as a little duchess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like mother, like child,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;proud
and poor, proud and poor; that tells the whole story.
Well, shall I write to Ruth, Mis. Hall, about Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;let me manage that; you
will upset the whole business if you do. I&rsquo;ve a plan in
my head, and to-morrow, after breakfast, I&rsquo;ll take the old
chaise, and go in after Katy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, the old lady, on the following
day, climbed up into an old-fashioned chaise, and turned
the steady old horse&rsquo;s nose in the direction of the city;
jerking at the reins, and clucking and gee-ing him up,
after the usual awkward fashion of sexegenarian female
drivers. Using Miss Tiffkin&rsquo;s land-mark, the little black
grocery-shop, for a guide-board, she soon discovered
Ruth&rsquo;s abode; and so well did she play her part in commiserating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Ruth&rsquo;s misfortunes, and Katy&rsquo;s sickly appearance,
that the widow&rsquo;s kind heart was immediately tortured
with the most unnecessary self-reproaches, which
prepared the way for an acceptance of her invitation for
Katy &ldquo;for a week or two;&rdquo; great promises, meanwhile,
being held out to the child of &ldquo;a little pony to ride,&rdquo; and
various other tempting lures of the same kind. Still
little Katy hesitated, clinging tightly to her mother&rsquo;s
dress, and looking, with her clear, searching eyes, into her
grandmother&rsquo;s face, in a way that would have embarrassed
a less artful man&oelig;uverer. The old lady understood the
glance, and put it on file, to be attended to at her leisure;
it being no part of her present errand to play the unamiable.
Little Katy, finally won over, consented to make
the visit, and the old chaise was again set in motion for
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;How</span> d&rsquo;ye do, Ruth?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ellet, the next
morning, as he ran against Ruth in the street;
&ldquo;glad you have taken my advice, and done a sensible
thing at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; answered Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the doctor told me yesterday that you had
given Katy up to them, to bring up; you would have
done better if you had sent off Nettie too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not &lsquo;given Katy up,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Ruth, starting and
blushing deeply; &ldquo;and they could not have understood it
so; she has only gone on a visit of a fortnight, to recruit
a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh&mdash;pooh!&rdquo; replied Mr. Ellet. &ldquo;The thing is
quietly over with; now don&rsquo;t make a fuss. The old folks
expect to keep her. They wrote to me about it, and I
approved of it. It&rsquo;s the best thing all round; and, as I
just said, it would have been better still if Nettie had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
gone, too. Now don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself; you can
go once in awhile, I suppose, to see the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>How</em> can I go?&rdquo; asked Ruth, looking her father calmly
in the face; &ldquo;it costs fifty cents every trip, by railroad,
and you know I have not the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to decide,&rdquo; answered the father coldly;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered about such trifles. It is the way you
always do, Ruth, whenever I see you; but it is time I was
at my office. Don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself, now; mind
what I tell you, and let well alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop&mdash;can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, moving rapidly
down street, to get out of his daughter&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible,&rdquo; thought Ruth, looking after him,
&ldquo;that he could connive at such duplicity? Was the old
lady&rsquo;s sympathy a mere stratagem to work upon my
feelings? How unnecessarily I reproached myself with
my supposed injustice to her? Can <em>good</em> people do such
things? Is religion only a fable? No, no; &lsquo;let God be
true, and every man a liar.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIX</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Is</span> this &lsquo;The Daily Type&rsquo; office?&rdquo; asked Ruth of a
printer&rsquo;s boy, who was rushing down five steps at a
time, with an empty pail in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All you have to do is to ask, mem. You&rsquo;ve got a
tongue in your head, haven&rsquo;t ye? women folks generally
has,&rdquo; said the little ruffian.</p>

<p>Ruth, obeying this civil invitation, knocked gently at
the office door. A whir of machinery, and a bad odor
of damp paper and cigar smoke, issued through the half-open
crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to walk in,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;they never will
hear my feeble knock amid all this racket and bustle;&rdquo;
and pushing the door ajar, she found herself in the midst
of a group of smokers, who, in slippered feet, and with
heels higher than their heads, were whiffing and laughing,
amid the pauses of conversation, most uproariously.
Ruth&rsquo;s face crimsoned as heels and cigars remained in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</i>, and her glance was met by a rude stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I called to see if you would like a new contributor to
your paper,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;if so, I will leave a few samples
of my articles for your inspection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Bill?&rdquo; said the person addressed;
&ldquo;drawer full as usual, I suppose, isn&rsquo;t it? more chaff than
wheat, too, I&rsquo;ll swear; don&rsquo;t want any, ma&rsquo;am; come
now, Jo, let&rsquo;s hear the rest of that story; shut the door,
ma&rsquo;am, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the editor of the &lsquo;Parental Guide&rsquo;?&rdquo; said
Ruth, to a thin, cadaverous-looking gentleman, in a white
neck-cloth, and green spectacles, whose editorial sanctum
was not far from the office she had just left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you employ contributors for your paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I leave you this MS. for your inspection, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a copy of your paper here, sir, from which
I could judge what style of articles you prefer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the gentleman addressed raised his eyes for
the first time, wheeled his editorial arm-chair round,
facing Ruth, and peering over his green spectacles, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our paper, madam, is most em-phat-i-cal-ly a paper
devoted to the interests of religion; no frivolous jests,
no love-sick ditties, no fashionable sentimentalism, finds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
place in its columns. This is a serious world, madam,
and it ill becomes those who are born to die, to go
dancing through it. Josephus remarks that the Saviour
of the world was never known to smile. <em>I</em> seldom smile.
Are you a religious woman, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I endeavor to become so,&rdquo; answered Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong title="Very">V-e-r-y</strong> good; what sect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presbyterian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the white neck-clothed gentleman moved back
his chair: &ldquo;Wrong, madam, all wrong; I was educated by
the best of fathers, but he was <em>not</em> a Presbyterian; his
son is not a Presbyterian; his son&rsquo;s paper sets its face
like a flint against that heresy; no, madam, we shall
have no occasion for your contributions; a hope built on
a Presbyterian foundation, is built on the sand. Good
morning, madam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did Ruth despair? No! but the weary little feet
which for so many hours had kept pace with hers, needed
a reprieve. Little Nettie must go home, and Ruth must
read the office signs as she went along, to prepare for
new attempts on the morrow.</p>

<p>To-morrow? Would a brighter morrow <em>ever</em> come?
Ruth thought of her children, and said again with a
strong heart&mdash;<em>it will</em>; and taking little Netty upon her lap
she divided with her their frugal supper&mdash;a scanty bowl
of bread and milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth could not but acknowledge to herself that she
had thus far met with but poor encouragement, but she
knew that to climb, she must begin at the lowest round
of the ladder. It were useless to apply to a long-established
leading paper for employment, unless endorsed by
some influential name. Her brother had coolly, almost
contemptuously, set her aside; and yet in the very last
number of his Magazine, which accident threw in her
way, he pleaded for public favor for a young actress, whom
he said had been driven by fortune from the sheltered privacy
of home, to earn her subsistence upon the stage,
and whose earnest, strong-souled nature, he thought,
should meet with a better welcome than mere curiosity.
&ldquo;Oh, why not one word for me?&rdquo; thought Ruth; &ldquo;and
how can I ask of strangers a favor which a brother&rsquo;s
heart has so coldly refused?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very disagreeable applying to the small papers,
many of the editors of which, accustomed to dealing
with hoydenish contributors, were incapable of comprehending
that their manner towards Ruth had been
marked by any want of that respectful courtesy due to a
dignified woman. From all such contact Ruth shrank
sensitively; their free-and-easy tone fell upon her ear so
painfully, as often to bring the tears to her eyes. Oh,
if Harry&mdash;but she must not think of him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day Ruth wandered about the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
streets, looking into office-entries, reading signs, and trying
to gather from their &ldquo;know-nothing&rdquo; hieroglyphics,
some light to illumine her darkened pathway. Day after
day chronicled only repeated failures, and now, notwithstanding
she had reduced their already meagre fare, her
purse was nearly empty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was a warm, sultry Sabbath morning; not a breath
of air played over the heated roofs of the great,
swarming city. Ruth sat in her little, close attic, leaning
her head upon her hand, weary, languid and dejected.
Life seemed to her scarce worth the pains to keep its
little flame flickering. A dull pain was in her temples,
a heavy weight upon her heart. Other Sabbaths, <em>happy</em>
Sabbaths, came up to her remembrance; earth looked so
dark to her now, heaven so distant, God&rsquo;s ways so inscrutable.</p>

<p>Hark to the Sabbath-bell!</p>

<p>Ruth took little Nettie by the hand, and led her slowly
to church. Other families, <em>unbroken</em> families, passed her
on their way; families whose sunny thresholds the destroying
angel had never crossed. Oh why the joy to
them, the pain to her? Sadly she entered the church,
and took her accustomed seat amid the worshippers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The man of God opened the holy book. Sweet and clear
fell upon Ruth&rsquo;s troubled ear these blessed words:
&ldquo;There remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of
God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bliss, the joy of heaven was pictured; life,&mdash;mysterious,
crooked, unfathomable life, made clear to the eye
of faith; sorrow, pain, suffering, ignominy even, made
sweet for His sake, who suffered all for us.</p>

<p>Ruth weeps! weeps that her faith was for an instant
o&rsquo;erclouded; weeps that she shrank from breasting the
foaming waves at the bidding of Him who said, &ldquo;It is I,
be not afraid.&rdquo; And she, who came there fluttering with
a broken wing, went away singing, soaring.</p>

<p>Oh man of God! pressed down with many cares, anxious
and troubled, sowing but not reaping, fearing to
bring in no sheaves for the harvest, be of good courage.
The arrow shot at a venture may to thine eye fall
aimless; but in the Book of Life shalt thou read many
an answer to the wrestling prayer, heard in thy closet
by God alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Fine</span> day, Mr. Ellet,&rdquo; said a country clergyman to
Ruth&rsquo;s father, as he sat comfortably ensconced in
his counting-room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but you look as young
as you did when I saw you five years ago. Life has
gone smoothly with you; you have been remarkably
prospered in business, Mr. Ellet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, who was inordinately
fond of talking of himself; &ldquo;yes, yes, I may say
that, though I came into Massachusetts a-foot, with a loaf
of bread and a sixpence, and now,&mdash;well, not to boast, I
own this house, and the land attached, beside my country-seat,
and have a nice little sum stowed away in the bank
for a rainy day; yes, Providence has smiled on my enterprise;
my affairs are, as you say, in a <em>very</em> prosperous
condition. I hope religion flourishes in your church,
brother Clark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead, as the valley of dry bones,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Clark with a groan. &ldquo;I have been trying to
&lsquo;get up a revival;&rsquo; but Satan reigns&mdash;Satan reigns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the right arm of the church seems paralysed. Sometimes
I think the stumbling-block is the avaricious and money-grabbing
spirit of its professors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ellet; &ldquo;there is a great
deal too much of that in the church. I alluded to it myself,
in my remarks at the last church-meeting. I called
it the accursed thing, the Achan in the camp, the Jonah
which was to hazard the Lord&rsquo;s Bethel, and I humbly
hope my remarks were blessed. I understand from the
last Monthly Concert, brother Clark, that there are good
accounts from the Sandwich Islands; twenty heathen admitted
to the church in one day; good news that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; groaned brother Clark, to whose blurred vision
the Sun of Righteousness was always clouded; &ldquo;yes, but
think how many more are still, and always will be,
worshipping idols; think how long it takes a missionary
to acquire a knowledge of the language; and think how
many, just as they become perfected in it, die of the climate,
or are killed by the natives, leaving their helpless
young families to burden the &lsquo;American Board.&rsquo; Very
sad, brother Ellet; sometimes, when I think of all this
outlay of money and human lives, and so little accomplished,
I&mdash;&rdquo; (here a succession of protracted sneezes
prevented Mr. Clark from finishing the sentence.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ellet, coming to the rescue; &ldquo;but if
only <em>one</em> heathen had been saved, there would be joy forever
in heaven. He who saveth a soul from death, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
know, hideth a multitude of sins. I think I spoke a word
in season, the other day, which has resulted in one admission,
at least, to our church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be hoped the new member will prove steadfast,&rdquo;
said the well-meaning but hypochondriac brother
Clark, with another groan. &ldquo;Many a hopeful convert
goes back to the world, and the last state of that soul is
worse than the first. Dreadful, dreadful. I am heartsick,
brother Ellet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Ruth&rsquo;s father, tapping him on the
shoulder; &ldquo;dinner is ready, will you sit down with us?
First salmon of the season, green peas, boiled fowl,
oysters, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; your country parishioners don&rsquo;t feed you
that way, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o,&rdquo; said brother Clark, &ldquo;no; there is no verse
in the whole Bible truer, or more dishonored in the observance,
than this, &lsquo;The laborer is worthy of his hire.&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll stay to dinner, brother Ellet. You have, I bless God,
a warm heart and a liberal one; your praise is in all the
churches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A self satisfied smile played round the lips of Ruth&rsquo;s
father, at this tribute to his superior sanctity; and, seating
himself at the well-spread table, he uttered an unusually
lengthy grace.</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p>&ldquo;Some more supper, please, Mamma,&rdquo; vainly pleaded
little Nettie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ruth</span> had found employment. Ruth&rsquo;s MSS. had been
accepted at the office of &ldquo;The Standard.&rdquo; Yes, an
article of hers was to be published in the very next issue.
The remuneration was not what Ruth had hoped, but it
was at least a <em>beginning</em>, a stepping-stone. What a pity
that Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s (the editor&rsquo;s) rule was, not to pay a
contributor, even after a piece was accepted, until it was
printed&mdash;and Ruth so short of funds. Could she hold out
to work so hard, and fare so rigidly? for often there was
only a crust left at night; but, God be thanked, she
should now <em>earn</em> that crust! It was a pity that oil was
so dear, too, because most of her writing must be done
at night, when Nettie&rsquo;s little prattling voice was hushed,
and her innumerable little wants forgotten in sleep. Yes,
it <em>was</em> a pity that good oil was so dear, for the cheaper
kind crusted so soon on the wick, and Ruth&rsquo;s eyes, from
excessive weeping, had become quite tender, and often
very painful. Then it would be so mortifying should a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
mistake occur in one of her articles. She must write very
legibly, for type-setters were sometimes sad bunglers,
making people accountable for words that would set Worcester&rsquo;s
or Webster&rsquo;s hair on end; but, poor things, <em>they</em>
worked hard too&mdash;they had <em>their</em> sorrows, thinking, long
into the still night, as they scattered the types, more of
their dependent wives and children, than of the orthography
of a word, or the rhetoric of a sentence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scratch&mdash;scratch&mdash;scratch, went Ruth&rsquo;s pen; the dim
lamp flickering in the night breeze, while the deep breathing
of the little sleepers was the watchword, <em>On!</em> to
her throbbing brow and weary fingers. One o&rsquo;clock&mdash;two
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the lamp burns low in the
socket. Ruth lays down her pen, and pushing back the
hair from her forehead, leans faint and exhausted against
the window-sill, that the cool night-air may fan her heated
temples. How impressive the stillness! Ruth can
almost hear her own heart beat. She looks upward, and
the watchful stars seem to her like the eyes of gentle
friends. No, God would <em>not</em> forsake her! A sweet
peace steals into her troubled heart, and the overtasked
lids droop heavily over the weary eyes.</p>

<p>Ruth sleeps.</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p>Daylight! Morning <em>so</em> soon? All night Ruth has
leaned with her head on the window-sill, and now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
wakes unrefreshed from the constrained posture; but she
has no time to heed <em>that</em>, for little Nettie lies moaning in
her bed with pain; she lifts the little creature in her lap,
rocks her gently, and kisses her cheek; but still little
Nettie moans. Ruth goes to the drawer and looks in
her small purse (Harry&rsquo;s gift); it is empty! then she
clasps her hands and looks again at little Nettie. Must
Nettie die for want of care? Oh, if Mr. Lescom would
<em>only</em> advance her the money for the contributions he had
accepted, but he said so decidedly that &ldquo;it was a rule he
<em>never</em> departed from;&rdquo; and there were yet five long days
before the next paper would be out. Five days! what
might not happen to Nettie in five days? There was her
cousin, Mrs. Millet, but she had muffled her furniture in
linen wrappers, and gone to the springs with her family,
for the summer months; there was her father, but had
he not said &ldquo;Remember, if you <em>will</em> burden yourself with
your children, you must not look to me for help.&rdquo; Kissing
little Nettie&rsquo;s cheek she lays her gently on the bed,
whispering in a husky voice, &ldquo;only a few moments, Nettie;
mamma will be back soon.&rdquo; She closes the door
upon the sick child, and stands with her hand upon her
bewildered brow, thinking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, madam; the entry is so very dark
I did not see you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bond; &ldquo;you are as early a
riser as myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My child is sick,&rdquo; answered Ruth, tremulously; &ldquo;I
was just going out for medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you approve of Hom&oelig;opathy,&rdquo; said Mr. Bond,
&ldquo;and will trust me to prescribe, there will be no necessity
for your putting yourself to that trouble; I always
treat myself hom&oelig;opathically in sickness, and happen to
have a small supply of those medicines by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s natural independence revolted at the idea of
receiving a favor from a stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you disapprove of Hom&oelig;opathy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bond, mistaking the cause of her momentary hesitation;
&ldquo;it works like a charm with children; but if you prefer
not to try it, allow me to go out and procure you whatever
you desire in the way of medicine; you will not
then be obliged to leave your child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was another dilemma&mdash;what <em>should</em> Ruth do?
Why, clearly accept his first offer; there was an air of
goodness and sincerity about him, which, added to his
years, seemed to invite her confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond stepped in, looked at Nettie, and felt her
pulse. &ldquo;Ah, little one, we will soon have you better,&rdquo;
said he, as he left the room to obtain his little package
of medicines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, with a grateful smile, as he
administered to Nettie some infinitesimal pills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Mr. Bond. &ldquo;I learned two
years since to doctor myself in this way, and I have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
had the pleasure of relieving others in emergencies
like this, from my little Hom&oelig;opathic stores. You will
find that your little girl will soon fall into a sweet sleep,
and awake much relieved; if you are careful with her,
she will, I think, need nothing more in the way of medicine,
or if she should, my advice is quite at your service;&rdquo;
and, taking his pitcher of water in his hand, he
bowed respectfully, and wished Ruth good morning.</p>

<p>Who was he? what was he? Whir&mdash;whir&mdash;there
was the noise again! That he was a man of refined and
courteous manners, was very certain. Ruth felt glad he
was so much her senior; he seemed so like what Ruth
had sometimes dreamed a kind father might be, that it
lessened the weight of the obligation. Already little
Nettie had ceased moaning; her little lids began to droop,
and her skin, which had been hot and feverish, became
moist and cool. &ldquo;May God reward him, whoever he
may be,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Surely it <em>is</em> blessed to <em>trust</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was four o&rsquo;clock of a hot August afternoon. The
sun had crept round to the front piazza of the doctor&rsquo;s
cottage. No friendly trees warded off his burning rays,
for the doctor &ldquo;liked a prospect;&rdquo; <abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr> he liked to sit at
the window and count the different trains which whizzed
past in the course of the day; the number of wagons,
and gigs, and carriages, that rolled lazily up the hill; to
see the village engine, the &ldquo;Cataract,&rdquo; drawn out on the
green for its weekly ablutions, and to count the bundles
of shingles that it took to roof over Squire Ruggles&rsquo;
new barn. No drooping vines, therefore, or creepers, intruded
between him and this pleasant &ldquo;prospect.&rdquo; The
doctor was an utilitarian; he could see &ldquo;no use&rdquo; in such
things, save to rot timber and harbor vermin. So a wondrous
glare of white paint, (carefully renewed every
spring,) blinded the traveler whose misfortune it was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
pass the road by the doctor&rsquo;s house. As I said, it was
now four o&rsquo;clock. The twelve o&rsquo;clock dinner was long
since over. The Irish girl had rinsed out her dish-towels,
hung them out the back door to dry, and gone down to
the village store to buy some new ribbons advertised as
selling at an &ldquo;immense sacrifice&rdquo; by the disinterested
village shopkeeper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us peep into the doctor&rsquo;s sitting room; the air of
this room is close and stifled, for the windows must be
tightly closed, lest some audacious fly should make his
mark on the old lady&rsquo;s immaculate walls. A centre
table stands in the middle of the floor, with a copy of
&ldquo;The Religious Pilot,&rdquo; last year&rsquo;s Almanac, A Directory,
and &ldquo;The remarkable Escape of Eliza Cook,
who was partially scalped by the Indians.&rdquo; On one side
of the room hangs a piece of framed needle-work, by the
virgin fingers of the old lady, representing an unhappy
female, weeping over a very high and very perpendicular
tombstone, which is hieroglyphiced over with untranslateable
characters in red worsted, while a few herbs, not
mentioned by botanists, are struggling for existence at
its base. A friendly willow-tree, of a most extraordinary
shade of blue green, droops in sympathy over the
afflicted female, while a nondescript looking bird, resembling
a dropsical bull-frog, suspends his song and one
leg, in the foreground. It was principally to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
this chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre of art, that the windows were hermetically
sealed to the entrance of vagrant flies.</p>

<p>The old doctor, with his spectacles awry and his hands
drooping listlessly at his side, snored from the depths of
his arm-chair, while opposite him the old lady, peering
out from behind a very stiffly-starched cap border, was
&ldquo;seaming,&rdquo; &ldquo;widening,&rdquo; and &ldquo;narrowing,&rdquo; with a precision
and perseverance most painful to witness. Outside,
the bee hummed, the robin twittered, the shining leaves of
the village trees danced and whispered to the shifting
clouds; the free, glad breeze swept the tall meadow-grass,
and the village children, as free and fetterless, danced and
shouted at their sports; but there sat little Katy, with
her hands crossed in her lap, as she <em>had</em> sat for many an
hour, listening to the never-ceasing click of her grandmother&rsquo;s
needles, and the sonorous breathings of the
doctor&rsquo;s rubicund nose. Sometimes she moved uneasily
in her chair, but the old lady&rsquo;s uplifted finger would immediately
remind her that &ldquo;little girls must be seen and
not heard.&rdquo; It was a great thing for Katy when a mouse
scratched on the wainscot, or her grandmother&rsquo;s ball
rolled out of her lap, giving her a chance to stretch her
little cramped limbs. And now the village bell began to
toll, with a low, booming, funereal sound, sending a cold
shudder through the child&rsquo;s nervous and excited frame.
What if <em>her</em> mother should die way off in the city?
What if she should <em>always</em> live in this terrible way at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
grandmother&rsquo;s? with nobody to love her, or kiss her, or
pat her little head kindly, and say, &ldquo;Katy, dear;&rdquo; and
again the bell boomed out its mournful sound, and little
Katy, unable longer to bear the torturing thoughts it
called up, sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>It was all in vain, that the frowning old lady held up
her warning finger; the flood-gates were opened, and Katy
could not have stopped her tears had her life depended
on it.</p>

<p>Hark! a knock at the door! a strange footstep!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; shrieked the child hysterically, &ldquo;mother!&rdquo;
and flew into Ruth&rsquo;s sheltering arms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>shall</em> we do, doctor?&rdquo; asked the old lady, the
day after Ruth&rsquo;s visit. &ldquo;I trusted to her not being able
to get the money to come out here, and her father, I
knew, wouldn&rsquo;t give it to her, and now here she has
walked the whole distance, with Nettie in her arms, except
a lift a wagoner or two gave her on the road; and I
verily believe she would have done it, had it been twice
the distance it is. I never shall be able to bring up that
child according to my notions, while <em>she</em> is round. I&rsquo;d
forbid her the house, (she deserves it,) only that it won&rsquo;t
sound well if she tells of it. And to think of that ungrateful
little thing&rsquo;s flying into her mother&rsquo;s arms as if
she was in the last extremity, after all we have done for
her. I don&rsquo;t suppose Ruth would have left her with us, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
it is, if she had the bread to put in her mouth. She might
as well give her up, though, first as last, for she never
will be able to support her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fit for nothing but a parlor ornament,&rdquo; said the
doctor, &ldquo;never was. No more business talent in Ruth
Ellet, than there is in that chany image of yours on the
mantle-tree, Mis. Hall. That tells the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;I have</span> good news for you,&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom to
Ruth, at her next weekly visit; &ldquo;your very first articles
are copied, I see, into many of my exchanges, even
into the &mdash;&mdash;, which seldom contains anything but
politics. A good sign for you, Mrs. Hall; a good test of
your popularity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and her whole face glowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies <em>like</em> to be praised,&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom, good-humoredly,
with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not that&mdash;not that, sir,&rdquo; said Ruth, with a
sudden moistening of the eye, &ldquo;it is because it will be
bread for my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lescom checked his mirthful mood, and said,
&ldquo;Well, here is something good for me, too; a letter from
Missouri, in which the writer says, that if &ldquo;Floy&rdquo; (a
pretty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i> that of yours, Mrs. Hall) is to be a
contributor for the coming year, I may put him down as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a subscriber, as well as S. Jones, E. May, and J. Noyes,
all of the same place. That&rsquo;s good news for <em>me</em>, you
see,&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom, with one of his pleasant, beaming
smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ruth, abstractedly. She was wondering
if her articles were to be the means of swelling Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s
subscription list, whether <em>she</em> ought not to profit by
it as well as himself, and whether she should not ask him
to increase her pay. She pulled her gloves off and on,
and finally mustered courage to clothe her thought in words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just <em>like</em> a woman,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lescom,
turning it off with a joke; &ldquo;give them the least foot-hold,
and they will want the whole territory. Had I not
shown you that letter, you would have been quite contented
with your present pay. Ah! I see it won&rsquo;t do to
talk so unprofessionally to you; and you needn&rsquo;t expect,&rdquo;
said he, smiling, &ldquo;that I shall ever speak of letters containing
new subscribers on your account. I could easily
get you the offer of a handsome salary by publishing
such things. No&mdash;no, I have been foolish enough to lose
two or three valuable contributors in that way; I have
learned better than that, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;;&rdquo; and taking out his
purse, he paid Ruth the usual sum for her articles.</p>

<p>Ruth bowed courteously, and put the money in her
purse; but she sighed as she went down the office
stairs. Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s view of the case was a business
one, undoubtedly; and the same view that almost any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
other business man would have taken, <abbr class="nc" title="namely">viz.</abbr>: to retain
her at her present low rate of compensation, till he was
necessitated to raise it by a higher bid from a rival
quarter. And so she must plod wearily on till that time
came, and poor Katy must still be an exile; for she had
not enough to feed her, her landlady having raised the
rent of her room two shillings, and Ruth being unable to
find cheaper accommodations. It <em>was</em> hard, but what
could be done? Ruth believed she had exhausted all the
offices she knew of. Oh! there was one, &ldquo;The Pilgrim;&rdquo;
she had not tried there. She would call at the office on
her way home.</p>

<p>The editor of &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rdquo; talked largely. He
had, now, plenty of contributors; he didn&rsquo;t know about
employing a new one. Had she ever written? and <em>what</em>
had she written? Ruth showed him her article in the
last number of &ldquo;The Standard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;hum&mdash;hum!&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts, changing his
tone; &ldquo;so you are &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; are you?&rdquo; (casting his eyes
on her.) &ldquo;What pay do they give you over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth was a novice in business-matters, but she had
strong common sense, and that common sense said, he
has no right to ask you that question; don&rsquo;t you tell
him; so she replied with dignity, &ldquo;My bargain, sir, with
Mr. Lescom was a private one, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said the foiled Mr. Tibbetts; adding in an
under-tone to his partner, &ldquo;sharp that!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I conclude to engage you,&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts,
&ldquo;I should prefer you would write for me over a
different signature than the one by which your pieces are
indicated at The Standard office, or you can write exclusively
for my paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to your first proposal,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;if
I have gained any reputation by my first efforts, it appears
to me that I should be foolish to throw it away by
the adoption of another signature; and with regard to
the last, I have no objection to writing exclusively for
you, if you will make it worth my while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharp again,&rdquo; whispered Tibbetts to his partner.</p>

<p>The two editors then withdrawing into a further corner
of the office, a whispered consultation followed, during
which Ruth heard the words, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford it, Tom;
hang it! we are head over ears in debt now to that paper
man; good articles though&mdash;deuced good&mdash;must have her
if we dispense with some of our other contributors.
We had better begin low though, as to terms, for she&rsquo;ll
go up now like a rocket, and when she finds out her
value we shall have to increase her pay, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Thank you, gentlemen, thought Ruth, when the cards
change hands, I&rsquo;ll take care to return the compliment.)</p>

<p>In pursuance of Mr. Tibbetts&rsquo; shrewd resolution, he
made known his &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; terms to Ruth, which were
no advance upon her present rate of pay at The Standard.
This offer being declined, they made her another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in which, since she would not consent to do otherwise,
they agreed she should write over her old signature,
&ldquo;Floy,&rdquo; furnishing them with two articles a week.</p>

<p>Ruth accepted the terms, poor as they were, because
she could at present do no better, and because every
pebble serves to swell the current.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Months passed away, while Ruth hoped and toiled,
&ldquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rdquo; fame as a writer increasing much faster than
her remuneration. There was rent-room to pay, little
shoes and stockings to buy, oil, paper, pens, and ink to
find; and now autumn had come, she could not write
with stiffened fingers, and wood and coal were ruinously
high, so that even with this new addition to her labor,
Ruth seemed to retrograde pecuniarily, instead of
advancing; and Katy still away! She must work
harder&mdash;harder. Good, brave little Katy; she, too, was
bearing and hoping on&mdash;mamma had promised, if she
would stay there, patiently, she would certainly take her
away just as soon as she had earned money enough; and
mamma <em>never</em> broke her promise&mdash;<em>never</em>; and Katy
prayed to God every night, with childish trust, to help her
mother to earn money, that she might soon go home again.</p>

<p>And so, while Ruth scribbled away in her garret, the
public were busying themselves in conjecturing who
&ldquo;Floy&rdquo; might be. Letters poured in upon Mr. Lescom,
with their inquiries, even bribing him with the offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to procure a certain number of subscribers, if he would
divulge her real name; to all of which the old
man, true to his promise to Ruth, to keep her secret inviolate,
turned a deaf ear. All sorts of rumors became
rife about &ldquo;Floy,&rdquo; some maintaining her to be a man,
because she had the courage to call things by their right
names, and the independence to express herself boldly
on subjects which to the timid and clique-serving, were
tabooed. Some said she was a disappointed old maid;
some said she was a designing widow; some said she was
a moon-struck girl; and all said she was a nondescript.
Some tried to imitate her, and failing in this, abused
and maligned her; the outwardly strait-laced and inwardly
corrupt, puckered up their mouths and &ldquo;blushed
for her;&rdquo; the hypocritical denounced the sacrilegious fingers
which had dared to touch the Ark; the fashionist
voted her a vulgar, plebeian thing; and the earnest and
sorrowing, to whose burdened hearts she had given voice,
cried God speed her. And still &ldquo;Floy&rdquo; scribbled on,
thinking only of bread for her children, laughing and
crying behind her mask,&mdash;laughing all the more when
her heart was heaviest; but of this her readers knew
little and would have cared less. Still her little bark
breasted the billows, now rising high on the topmost
wave, now merged in the shadows, but still steering
with straining sides, and a heart of oak, for the nearing
port of Independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s brother, Hyacinth, saw &ldquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rdquo; articles floating
through his exchanges with marked dissatisfaction and
uneasiness. That she should have succeeded in any degree
without his assistance, was a puzzle, and the premonitory
symptoms of her popularity, which his weekly exchanges
furnished, in the shape of commendatory notices, were
gall and wormwood to him. <em>Something</em> must be done,
and that immediately. Seizing his pen, he despatched a
letter to Mrs. Millet, which he requested her to read to
Ruth, alluding very contemptuously to Ruth&rsquo;s articles,
and begging her to use her influence with Ruth to desist
from scribbling, and seek some other employment.
<em>What</em> employment, he did not condescend to state; in
fact, it was a matter of entire indifference to him, provided
she did not cross his track. Ruth listened to the
contents of the letter, with the old bitter smile, and went
on writing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A dull</span>, drizzling rain spattered perseveringly against
Ruth&rsquo;s windows, making her little dark room tenfold
gloomier and darker than ever. Little Nettie had
exhausted her slender stock of toys, and creeping up to
her mother&rsquo;s side, laid her head wearily in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait just a moment, Nettie, till mamma finishes this
page,&rdquo; said Ruth, dipping her pen again in the old stone
inkstand.</p>

<p>The child crept back again to the window, and watched
the little pools of water in the streets, as the rain-drops
dimpled them, and saw, for the hundredth time, the grocer&rsquo;s
boy carrying home a brown-paper parcel for some
customers, and eating something from it as he went along;
and listened to the milkman, who thumped so loudly
on the back gates, and seemed always in such a tearing
hurry; and saw the baker open the lid of his boxes, and
let the steam escape from the smoking hot cakes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
pies. Nettie wished she could have some of them, but
she had long since learned <em>only to wish</em>; and then she
saw the two little sisters who went by to school every
morning, and who were now cuddling, laughingly together,
under a great big umbrella, which the naughty wind
was trying to turn inside out, and to get away from them;
and then Nettie thought of Katy, and wished she had
Katy to play with her, when mamma wrote such a long,
long time; and then little Nettie drew such a heavy sigh,
that Ruth dashed down her pen, and taking her in her
arms and kissing her, told her about,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Mistress McShuttle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lived in a coal-scuttle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Along with her dog and her cat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What she did there, I can&rsquo;t tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I know very well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That none of the party were fat.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And then she narrated the exciting adventures of &ldquo;The
Wise Men of Gotham,&rdquo; who went to sea in that rudderless
bowl, and suffered shipwreck and &ldquo;total <em>lass</em> of life,&rdquo;
as the newsboys (God bless their rough-and-ready faces)
call it; and then little Nettie&rsquo;s snowy lids drooped over
her violet eyes, and she was far away in the land of
dreams, where there are no little hungry girls, or tired,
scribbling mammas.</p>

<p>Ruth laid the child gently on her little bed, and resumed
her pen; but the spell was broken, and &ldquo;careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and troubled about many things&rdquo; she laid it down again,
and her thoughts ran riot.</p>

<p>Pushing aside her papers, she discovered two unopened
letters which Mr. Lescom had handed her, and which she
had in the hurry of finishing her next article, quite forgotten.
Breaking the seal of the first, she read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To &lsquo;Floy.&rsquo;</span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am rough old man, Miss, and not used to writing
or talking to ladies. I don&rsquo;t know who you are, and
I don&rsquo;t ask; but I take &lsquo;The Standard,&rsquo; and I like your
pieces. I have a family of bouncing girls and boys; and
when we&rsquo;ve all done work, we get round the fire of an
evening, while one of us reads your pieces aloud. It
may not make much difference to you what an old man
thinks, but I tell you those pieces have got the real stuff
in &rsquo;em, and so I told my son John the other night; and <em>he</em>
says, and <em>I</em> say, and neighbor Smith, who comes in to
hear &rsquo;em, says, that you ought to make a book of them,
so that your readers may keep them. You can put me
down for three copies, to begin with; and if every subscriber
to &lsquo;The Standard&rsquo; feels as I do, you might make a
plum by the operation. Suppose, now, you think of it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;N.&nbsp;B.&mdash;John says, maybe you&rsquo;ll be offended at my
writing to you, but I say you&rsquo;ve got too much common
sense.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;Yours to command,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;John Stokes.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a thought
that never entered this busy head of mine, John Stokes.
<em>I</em> publish a book? Why, John, are you aware that those
articles were written for bread and butter, not fame; and
tossed to the printer before the ink was dry, or I had time
for a second reading? And yet, perhaps, there is more
freshness about them than there would have been, had I
leisure to have pruned and polished them&mdash;who knows?
I&rsquo;ll put your suggestion on file, friend Stokes, to be
turned over at my leisure. It strikes me, though, that it
will keep awhile. Thank you, honest John. It is just
such readers as you whom I like to secure. Well, what
have we here?&rdquo; and Ruth broke the seal of the second
letter. It was in a delicate, beautiful, female hand; just
such an one as you, dear Reader, might trace, whose
sweet, soft eyes, and long, drooping tresses, are now
bending over this page. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you <em>are</em> &lsquo;dear&rsquo; to me, dear as a sister on
whose loving breast I have leaned, though I never saw
your face. I know not whether you are young and fair,
or old and wrinkled, but I know that your heart is fresh,
and guileless, and warm as childhood&rsquo;s; and that every
week your printed words come to me, in my sick chamber,
like the ministrations of some gentle friend, sometimes
stirring to its very depths the fountain of tears, sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
by odd and quaint conceits, provoking the mirthful
smile. But &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; I love you best in your serious
moods; for as earth recedes, and eternity draws near, it
is the real and tangible, my soul yearns after. And sure
I am, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; that I am not mistaken in thinking that we
both lean on the same Rock of Ages; both discern,
through the mists and clouds of time, the Sun of Righteousness.
I shall never see you, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; on earth;&mdash;mysterious
voices, audible only to the dying ear, are calling
me away; and yet, before I go, I would send you this
token of my love, for all the sweet and soul-strengthening
words you have unconsciously sent to my sick chamber,
to wing the weary, waiting hours. We shall <em>meet</em>, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;;
but it will be where &lsquo;tears are wiped away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my unknown sister.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Mary R. &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s head bowed low upon the table, and her lips
moved; but He to whom the secrets of all hearts are
known, alone heard that grateful prayer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">That</span> first miserable day at school! Who that has
known it&mdash;even with a mother&rsquo;s kiss burning on the
cheek, a big orange bumping in the new satchel, and a
promise of apple-dumplings for dinner, can review it without
a shudder? Torturing&mdash;even when you can run
home and &ldquo;tell mother&rdquo; all your little griefs; when
every member of the home circle votes it &ldquo;<em>a shame</em>&rdquo; that
Johnny Oakes laughed because you did not take your
alphabet the natural way, instead of receiving it by inoculation,
(just as he forgets that <em>he</em> did;) torturing&mdash;when
Bill Smith, and Tom Simms, with whom you have
&ldquo;swapped alleys,&rdquo; and played &ldquo;hockey,&rdquo; are there with
their familiar faces, to take off the chill of the new schoolroom;
torturing&mdash;to the sensitive child, even when the
teacher is a sunny-faced young girl, instead of a prim old
ogre. Poor little Katy! her book was before her; but
the lines blurred into one indistinct haze, and her throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
seemed filling to suffocation with long-suppressed sobs.
The teacher, if he thought anything about it, thought she
had the tooth-ache, or ear-ache, or head-ache; and Katy
kept her own secret, for she had read his face correctly,
and with a child&rsquo;s quick instinct, stifled down her throbbing
little heart.</p>

<p>To the doctor, and &ldquo;Mis. Hall,&rdquo; with their anti-progressive
notions, a school was a school. The committee
had passed judgment on it, and I would like to know who
would be insane enough to question the decision of a
School Committee? What did the committee care, that
the consumptive teacher, for his own personal convenience,
madly excluded all ventilation, and heated the little
sheet-iron stove hotter than Shadrack&rsquo;s furnace, till little
heads snapped, and cheeks crimsoned, and croup stood
ready at the threshold to seize the first little bare throat
that presented its perspiring surface to the keen frosty
air? What did <em>they</em> care that the desks were so constructed,
as to crook spines, and turn in toes, and round
shoulders? What did they care that the funnel smoked
week after week, till the curse of &ldquo;weak eyes&rdquo; was entailed
on their victims for a lifetime? They had other
irons in the fire, to which this was a cipher. For instance:
the village pump was out of repair, and town-meeting
after town-meeting had been called, to see who <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em>
make its handle fly. North Gotham said it was the business
of East Gotham; East Gotham said the pump might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
rot before they&rsquo;d bear the expense; not that the East
Gothamites cared for expense&mdash;no; they scorned the insinuation,
but they&rsquo;d have North Gotham to know that
East Gotham wasn&rsquo;t to be put upon. Jeremiah Stubbs,
a staunch North Gothamite, stopped buying molasses and
calico at &ldquo;Ezekial Tibbs&rsquo; East Gotham Finding Store;&rdquo;
and Ezekial Tibbs forbade, under penalty of losing his
custom, the carpenter who was repairing his pig-sty,
from buying nails any more of Jeremiah Stubbs, of
North Gotham; matches were broken up; &ldquo;own cousins&rdquo;
ceased to know one another, and the old women had a
millenial time of it over their bohea, discussing and settling
matters; no marvel that such a trifle as a child&rsquo;s
school should be overlooked. Meantime there stood
the pump, with its impotent handle, high and dry; &ldquo;a
gone sucker,&rdquo; as Mr. Tibbs facetiously expressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to school to-day, Katy, it is washing-day,&rdquo;
said old Mrs. Hall; &ldquo;go get that stool, now sit
down on it, at my feet, and let me cut off those foolish
dangling curls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma likes them,&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied the old lady, with a malicious
smile, as she gathered a cluster of them in one hand and
seized the scissors with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Papa</em> liked them,&rdquo; said Katy, shrinking back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the old lady; &ldquo;or, if he did,
&rsquo;twas only to please your foolish mother; any way they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
are coming off; if I don&rsquo;t like them, that&rsquo;s enough; you
are always to live with me now, Katy; it makes no difference
what your mother thinks or says about anything,
so you needn&rsquo;t quote <em>her</em>; I&rsquo;m going to try to make a
good girl of you, <abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr> if she will let you alone; you are
full of faults, just as she is, and I shall have to take a
great deal of pains with you. You ought to love me very
much for it, better than anybody else in the world&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>(No response from Katy.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Katy, you ought to love me better than anybody
else in the world,&rdquo; repeated the old lady, tossing a
handful of the severed ringlets down on the carpet. &ldquo;Do
you, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the truthful child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That tells the whole story,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he
started up and boxed Katy&rsquo;s ears; &ldquo;now go up and stay
in your room till I send for you, for being disrespectful
to your grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like mother&mdash;like child,&rdquo; said the old lady, as Katy
half shorn, moved like a culprit out of the room; then
gathering up in her apron the shining curls, she looked on
with a malicious smile, while they crisped and blackened
in the glowing Lehigh fire.</p>

<p>But miserable as were the week-days&mdash;Sunday, after
all, was the dreadful day for Katy; the long&mdash;long&mdash;long
Sunday, when every book in the house was put under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
lock and key; when even religious newspapers,
tracts, and memoirs, were tabooed; when the old people,
who fancied they could not go to church, sat from sunrise
to sunset in their best clothes, with their hands folded,
looking speechlessly into the fire; when there was no
dinner; when the Irish girl and the cat, equally lawless
and heretical, went to see their friends; when not a sound
was heard in the house, save the ticking of the old claw-footed-clock,
that stood in the entry; when Katy crept up
to her little room, and crouching in a corner, wondered
if God <em>was</em> good&mdash;why he let her papa <em>die</em>, and why he
did not help her mamma, who tried so hard to earn
money to bring her home.</p>

<p>The last bright golden beam of the Sabbath sun had
slowly faded away. One by one the stars came gliding
out. He who held them all in their places, listening ever
to the ceaseless music of their motion, yet bent a pitying
ear to the stifled sob of a troubled child. Softly&mdash;sweetly&mdash;fell
the gentle dew of slumber on weary eyelids,
while angels came to minister. Tears glittered still
on Katy&rsquo;s long lashes, but the little lips parted with a
smile, murmuring &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; Sleep on&mdash;dream on&mdash;little
Katy. He who noteth the sparrow&rsquo;s fall, hath given
his angels charge to keep thee.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> one of the thousand business offices, in one of the
thousand crowded streets of a neighboring city, sat
Mr. John Walter, with his legs crossed, his right finger
pressed against the right lobe of his organ of causality,
his right elbow resting on his right knee, and the fingers
of his left hand beating a sort of tattoo on a fresh copy
of The Standard, which lay upon the table by his side.
His attitude was one of profound meditation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who <em>can</em> she be?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Walter, in a
tone of blended interest and vexation; &ldquo;who can she
be?&rdquo; Mr. Walter raised his head, uncrossed his legs,
took up The Standard, and re-read &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; last article
slowly; often pausing to analyze the sentences, as though
he would extort from them some hidden meaning, to
serve as a clue to the identity of the author. After he
had perused the article thus searchingly, he laid down
The Standard, and again exclaimed, &ldquo;Who <em>can</em> she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
be? she is a genius certainly, whoever she is,&rdquo; continued
he, soliloquizingly; &ldquo;a bitter life experience she has had
too; she did not draw upon her imagination for this article.
Like the very first production of her pen that I
read, it is a wail from her inmost soul; so are many
of her pieces. A few dozen of them taken consecutively,
would form a whole history of wrong, and suffering, and
bitter sorrow. What a singular being she must be, if I
have formed a correct opinion of her; what powers of
endurance! What an elastic, strong, brave, loving, fiery,
yet soft and winning nature! A bundle of contradictions!
and how famously she has got on too! it is only
a little more than a year since her first piece was published,
and now her articles flood the whole country; I
seldom take up an exchange, which does not contain one
or more of them. That first piece of hers was a stroke
of genius&mdash;a real gem, although not very smoothly
polished; ever since I read it, I have been trying to find
out the author&rsquo;s name, and have watched her career with
eager interest; <em>her</em> career, I say, for I suppose &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;
to be a woman, notwithstanding the rumors to the contrary.
At any rate, my wife says so, and women have
an instinct about such things. I wish I knew whether
she gets well paid for her writings. Probably not. Inexperienced
writers seldom get more than a mere pittance.
There are so many ready to write (poor fools!)
for the honor and glory of the thing, and there are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
many ready to take advantage of this fact, and withhold
from needy talent the moral right to a deserved remuneration.
Thank heaven, I have never practiced this.
The &lsquo;Household Messenger&rsquo; does not yield me a very
large income, but what it does yield is fairly earned.
Why, bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Walter, suddenly starting
up, and as suddenly sitting down again; &ldquo;why has
not this idea occurred to me before? yes, why not engage
&lsquo;Floy&rsquo; to write for the Household Messenger? How I
wish I were rich, that I might give her such a price as
she really deserves. Let me see; she now writes for
The Standard, and The Pilgrim, four pieces a week for
each; eight pieces in all; that is too much work for her
to begin with; she cannot do herself justice; she ought
not to write, at the outside, more than two pieces a week;
then she could polish them up, and strengthen them, and
render them as nearly perfect in execution as they are in
conception. One piece a week would be as much as I
should wish; could I possibly afford to pay her as much,
or more for that one piece, as she now gets for eight?
Her name is a tower of strength, but its influence would
be frittered away, were she to write for more than one
paper. If I could secure her pen all to myself, the advertising
that such a connection would give The Messenger
would be worth something. Ah me, were my
purse only commensurate with my feelings. If I only
knew who &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is, and could have an interview with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
I might perhaps arrange matters so as to benefit us both;
and I <em>will</em> know,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Walter, jumping up
and pacing the room rapidly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know before I&rsquo;m a
month older;&rdquo; and the matter was settled; for when
John Walter paced the floor rapidly, and said &ldquo;I will,&rdquo;
Fate folded her hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;A letter</span> for &lsquo;Floy!&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom, smiling.
&ldquo;Another lover, I suppose. Ah! when you get to
be my age,&rdquo; continued the old man, stroking his silver
hair, &ldquo;you will treat their communications with more attention.&rdquo;
As he finished his remark, he held the letter
up playfully for a moment, and then tossed it into Ruth&rsquo;s
lap.</p>

<p>Ruth thrust it unread into her apron pocket. She was
thinking of her book, and many other things of far more
interest to her than lovers, if lover the writer were.
After correcting the proof of her articles for the next
week&rsquo;s paper, and looking over a few exchanges, she
asked for and received the wages due her for the last
articles published, and went home.</p>

<p>Ruth was wearied out; her walk home tired her more
than usual. Climbing to her room, she sat down without
removing her bonnet, and leaning her head upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
hand, tried to look hopefully into the future. She was
soon disturbed by Nettie, who exploring her mother&rsquo;s
pockets, and finding the letter, exclaimed, pointing to the
three cent stamp, &ldquo;May I have this pretty picture,
mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth drew forth the letter, opened the envelope, cut
out the stamp for Nettie, who soon suspended it around
her doll&rsquo;s neck for a medal, and then read the epistle,
which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&mdash;I have long wished to communicate with
you, long wished to know who you are. Since the appearance
of your first article, I have watched your course
with deep interest, and have witnessed your success with
the most unfeigned pleasure. My reasons for wishing to
make your acquaintance at this particular juncture,
are partly business and partly friendly reasons. As
you will see by a copy of the Household Messenger,
which I herewith send you, I am its Editor. I know
something about the prices paid contributors for the
periodical press, and have often wondered whether you
were receiving anything like such a remuneration as
your genius and practical newspaperial talent entitle you
to. I have also often wished to write you on the subject,
and tell you what I think is your market-value&mdash;to speak
in business phrase&mdash;as a writer; so that in case you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<em>not</em> receiving a just compensation, as things go, you might
know it, and act accordingly. In meditating upon the
subject, it has occurred to me that I might benefit you
and myself at the same time, and in a perfectly legitimate
manner, by engaging you to write solely for my
paper. I have made a calculation as to what I can afford
to give you, or rather what I <em>will</em> give you, for writing
one article a week for me, the article to be on any subject,
and of any length you please. Such an arrangement
would of course give you time to take more pains
with your writing, and also afford you such leisure for
relaxation, as every writer needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what I wish you to do is this: I want you first
to inform me what you get for writing for The Standard,
and The Pilgrim, and if I find that I can afford to give
you more, I will make you an offer. If I cannot give
you more, I will not trouble you further on that subject;
as I seek your benefit more than my own. In
case you should accept any offer which I should find it
proper to make, it would be necessary for you to tell me
your <em>real</em> name; as I should wish for a written contract,
in order to prevent any possibility of a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, I beg that you will permit me to say,
that whether or not arrangements are made for you to
write for me, I shall be most happy to serve you in any
way in my power. I have some experience in literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
matters, which I will gladly place at your disposal. In
short, madam, I feel a warm, brotherly interest in your
welfare, as well as a high admiration for your genius, and
it will afford me much pleasure to aid you, whenever my
services can be made profitable.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Very truly yours,</span>    <span class="sign1">John Walter.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth sat with the letter in her hand. The time <em>had</em>
been when not a doubt would have arisen in her mind as
to the sincerity of the writer; but, alas! adversity is so
rough a teacher! ever laying the cold finger of caution on
the warm heart of trust! Ruth sighed, and tossed the
letter on the table, half ashamed of herself for her cowardice,
and wishing that she <em>could</em> have faith in the
writer. Then she picked up the letter again. She examined
the hand-writing; it was bold and manly. She
thought it would be treating it too shabbily to throw it
aside among the love-sick trash she was in the habit of
receiving. She would read it again. The tone was respectful;
<em>that won her</em>. The &ldquo;Household Messenger&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;John
Walter?&rdquo;&mdash;she certainly had heard those names
before. The letter stated that a copy of the paper had
been sent her, but she had not yet received it. She recollected
now that she had seen the &ldquo;Household Messenger&rdquo;
among the exchanges at &ldquo;The Standard&rdquo; office, and
remembered that she always liked its appearance, and
admired its editorials; they were fearless and honest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
always on the side of the weak, and on the side of truth.
Ruth also had an indistinct remembrance of having heard
Mr. Walter spoken of by somebody, at some time, as a
most energetic young man, who had wrung success from
an unwilling world, and fought his way, single-handed,
from obscurity to an honorable position in society,
against, what would have been to many, overwhelming
odds. &ldquo;Hence the reason,&rdquo; thought Ruth, &ldquo;his heart so
readily vibrates to the chord of sorrow which I have
struck. His experienced heart has detected in my writings
the flutterings and desolation of his own.&rdquo; Ruth
wanted to believe in Mr. Walter. She glanced at his letter
again with increased interest and attention. It seemed
so frank and kind; but then it was bold and exacting, too.
The writer wished to know how much she received from the
&ldquo;Pilgrim,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Standard,&rdquo; and what was her real name.
Would it be prudent to entrust so much to an entire
stranger? and the very first time he asked, too? Even
granting he was actuated by the best of motives, would
he not think if she told him all, without requiring some
further guaranty on his part, that her confidence was too
easily won? Would he not think her too indiscreet to
be entrusted with his confidence? Would he not be apt
to believe that she had not even sufficient discretion on
which to base a business arrangement? And then, if his
letter <em>had been</em> dictated by idle curiosity only, how unfortunate
such an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</i> of her affairs might be. No&mdash;she&mdash;could&mdash;not&mdash;do&mdash;it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
But then, if Mr. Walter <em>were</em>
honest, if he <em>really</em> felt such a brotherly interest in her,
how sweet it would be to have him for a brother; a&mdash;<em>real,
warm-hearted, brotherly brother</em>, such as she had
never known. Ruth took up her pen to write to Mr.
Walter, but as quickly laid it down. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;cannot!&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;no, not to a stranger!&rdquo; Then, again she
seized her pen, and with a quick flush, and a warm tear,
said, half pettishly, half mournfully, &ldquo;Away with these
ungenerous doubts! Am I never again to put faith in
human nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth answered Mr. Walter&rsquo;s letter. She answered it
frankly and unreservedly. She stated what wages she
was then receiving. She told him her name. As she
went on, she felt a peace to which she had long been a
stranger. She often paused to wipe the tears&mdash;tears of
happiness&mdash;from her eyes. It was so sweet to believe in
<em>somebody</em> once more. She wrote a long letter&mdash;a sweet,
sisterly letter&mdash;pouring out her long pent-up feelings, as
though Mr. Walter had indeed been her brother, who,
having been away ever since before Harry&rsquo;s death, had
just returned, and, consequently, had known nothing
about her cruel sufferings. After she had sealed and
superscribed the letter, she became excessively frightened
at what she had done, and thought she never could send
it to Mr. Walter; but another perusal of his letter reassured
her. She rose to go to the post-office, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
became conscious that she had not removed her bonnet
and shawl, but had sat all this while in walking costume!
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, laughing, &ldquo;this <em>is</em> rather blue-stocking-y;
however, it is all the better, as I am now
ready for my walk.&rdquo; Ruth carried her letter to the
post-office; dropping it into the letter-box with more
hopeful feelings than Noah probably experienced when he
sent forth the dove from the ark for the third time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Walter</span> sat in his office, looking over the
morning mail. &ldquo;I wonder is this from &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
he said, as he examined a compact little package. &ldquo;It
bears the right post-mark, and the handwriting is a lady&rsquo;s.
A splendid hand it is, too. There&rsquo;s character in that
hand; I hope &rsquo;tis &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Walter broke the seal, and glancing at a few sentences,
turned to the signature. &ldquo;Yes, it is &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;!
now for a revelation.&rdquo; He then commenced perusing
the letter with the most intense interest. After reading
the first page his eye began to flash, and his lip to quiver.
&ldquo;Poor girl&mdash;poor girl&mdash;heartless creatures&mdash;too bad&mdash;too
bad,&rdquo; and other exclamations rather too warm for
publication; finishing the letter and refolding it, he paced
the room with a short, quick step, indicative of deep
interest, and determined purpose. &ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; he
exclaimed; &ldquo;shameful! the whole of it; and how hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
she has worked! and what a pitiful sum those fellows
pay her! it is contemptible. She has about made The
Standard; it never was heard of to any extent before she
commenced writing for it. It is perfectly outrageous; she
shall not write for them another day, if I can help it! I
will make her an offer at once. She will accept it; and
then those Jews will be brought to their senses. Ha! ha!
I know them! They will want to get her back; they will
write to me about it, or at least Lescom will. That will
give me a chance at him; and if I don&rsquo;t tell him a few
truths in plain English, my name is not John Walter.&rdquo;
Then seating himself at his desk, Mr. Walter wrote the
following letter to &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sister Ruth</span>,&mdash;If you will permit me to be so
brotherly. I have received, read, and digested your letter;
how it has affected me I will not now tell you. I
wish to say, however, that on reading that portion of it
which relates to the compensation you are now receiving,
my indignation exhausted the dictionary! Why, you
poor, dear little genius! what you write for those two
papers is worth, to the proprietors, ten times what they
pay you. But I will not bore you with compliments; I
wish to engage you to write for the Household Messenger,
and here is my offer: you to write one article a
week, length, matter and manner, to your own fancy; I
to pay you &mdash;&mdash;, the engagement to continue one year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
during which time you are not to write for any other
periodical, without my consent. My reason for placing a
limitation to our engagement is, that you may be able to
take advantage at that time of better offers, which you
will undoubtedly have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enclose duplicates, of a contract, which, if the terms
suit, you will please sign and return one copy <em>by the next
mail</em>; the other copy you will keep. Unless you accept
my offer by return of mail it will be withdrawn. You
may think this exacting; I will explain it in my next to
your satisfaction. Most truly your friend,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;John Walter.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter being despatched, thanks to the post-office
department, arrived promptly at its destination the next
morning.</p>

<p>Ruth sat with Mr. Walter&rsquo;s letter in her hand, thinking.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you do not accept my offer by return of mail,
it will be withdrawn.&rsquo; How exacting! &lsquo;the explanation of
this to be given in my next letter,&rsquo; ah, Mr. John Walter,
I shall not have to wait till then,&rdquo; soliloquized Ruth; &ldquo;I
can jump at your reason; you think I shall mention it to
Mr. Lescom, and that then he will interfere, and offer
something by way of an equivalent to tempt me to reject
it; that&rsquo;s it, Mr. John Walter! This bumping round the
world has at least sharpened my wits!&rdquo; and Ruth sat
beating a tattoo with the toe of her slipper on the carpet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and looking very profound and wise. Then she took up
the contract and examined it; it was brief, plain and
easily understood, <em>even by a woman</em>, as the men say.
&ldquo;It is a good offer,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;he is in earnest, so am
I; it&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo; Ruth signed the document.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Good</span> afternoon, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom to Ruth,
as she entered the Standard office, the day after she
had signed the contract with Mr. Walter. &ldquo;I was just
thinking of you, and wishing for an opportunity to have a
little private chat. Your articles are not as long as they
used to be; you must be more liberal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;that my articles had
grown any shorter. However, with me, an article is an
article, some of my shorter pieces being the most valuable
I have written. If you would like more matter, Mr. Lescom,
I wonder you have not offered me more pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom, smiling; &ldquo;women are
never satisfied. The more they get, the more grasping
they become. I have always paid you more than you
could get anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; replied Ruth. &ldquo;I believe I have never
troubled you with complaints; but I <em>have</em> looked at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
children sometimes, and thought that I must try somehow
to get more; and I have sometimes thought that if my
articles, as you have told me, were constantly bringing
you new subscribers, friendship, if not justice, would induce
you to raise my salary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Friendship</em> has nothing to do with business,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Lescom; &ldquo;a bargain is a bargain. The law of supply
and demand regulates prices in all cases. In literature,
at present, the supply greatly exceeds the demand,
consequently the prices are low. Of course, I have to
regulate my arrangements according to my own interests,
and not according to the interests of others. You, of
course, must regulate your arrangements according to
<em>your</em> interests; and if anybody else will give you more
than I do, you are at liberty to take it. As I said before,
<em>business</em> is one thing&mdash;<em>friendship</em> is another. Each is
good in its way, but they are quite distinct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Lescom finished this business-like and logical
speech, he looked smilingly at Ruth, with an air which
might be called one of tyrannical benevolence; as if he
would say, &ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;d like to know what you can
find to say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;that you think so, for I have
already acted in accordance with your sentiments. I have
had, and accepted, an offer of a better salary than you
pay me. My object in calling this afternoon was to inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
you of this; and to say, that I shall not be able to
write any more for &lsquo;The Standard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lescom looked astonished, and gazed at Ruth
without speaking, probably because he did not know exactly
what to say. He had argued Ruth&rsquo;s case so well,
while he supposed he was arguing his own, that nothing
more could be said. Mr. Lescom, in reality, valued Ruth&rsquo;s
services more than those of all his other contributors
combined, and the loss of them was a bitter thing to him.
And then, what would his subscribers say? The reason
of Ruth&rsquo;s leaving might become known; it would not
sound well to have it said that she quit writing for him
because he did not, or could not, or would not pay her as
much as others. Just then it occurred to him that engaging
to write for another journal, did not necessarily
preclude the possibility of her continuing to write for
&ldquo;The Standard.&rdquo; Catching eagerly at the idea, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; I am really glad that you have been so
fortunate. Of course I wish you to make as much as you
can, and should be glad, did my circumstances admit, to
give you a salary equal to what you can command elsewhere;
but as I cannot give you more than I have been
paying, I am glad somebody else will. Still, I see no
reason why you should stop writing for &lsquo;The Standard.&rsquo;
Your articles will just be as valuable to me, as though
you had made no new engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Lescom,&rdquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Ruth, &ldquo;but I cannot meet your wishes in this respect, as
the contract I have signed will not permit me to write for
any paper but &lsquo;The Household Messenger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s veil of good nature
was rent in twain. &ldquo;&lsquo;The Household Messenger!&rsquo;
Ah! it&rsquo;s John Walter, then, who has found you out?
I don&rsquo;t wish to boast, but I must say, that I think you
have made but a poor exchange. The whole thing is
very unfortunate for you. I was just making arrangements
to club with two other editors, and to offer you a
handsome yearly salary for writing exclusively for our
three papers; but of course that arrangement is all
knocked in the head now. It seems to me that you
might have made an exception in favor of &lsquo;The Standard.&rsquo;
I have no doubt that Mr. Walter would have consented
to let you write for it, as it was the first paper for which
you ever wrote. He would probably do so now if you
would ask him. He is an editor, and would understand
the matter at once. He would see that I had more than
ordinary claims upon you. What do you say to writing
him on the subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to doing so,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;if
you think it will avail anything, though if I succeed in
getting Mr. Walter&rsquo;s permission to write for <em>you</em>, I suppose
Mr. Tibbetts, of The Pilgrim, will wish me to do
the same for him, when he returns. I called at the Pilgrim
office this morning, and his partner, Mr. Elder, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
that he was out of town, and would not be home for several
days, and that he would be greatly incensed when he
heard I was going to leave, as I was getting very popular
with his subscribers. Mr. Elder was very sorry himself,
but he treated me courteously. By the way, Mr. Lescom,
I think you had better write to Mr. Walter, as well
as myself; you understand such matters, and can probably
write more to the point than I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Lescom, &ldquo;I will write to him
at once, and you had better write now by the same mail,
and have the letters both enclosed in one envelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth took a seat at the editorial table, and wrote to
Mr. Walter. The letters were sent at once to the Post-office,
so as to catch the afternoon mail, and Ruth took
her leave, promising to call on the morning of the second
day after, to see Mr. Walter&rsquo;s reply, which, judging by
his usual promptness, would arrive by that time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Ah!</span> another letter from &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Walter,
as he seated himself in his office; &ldquo;now I shall
hear how Lescom and Tibbetts &amp; Co. feel about losing
her. &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; had probably told them by the time she
wrote, and they have probably told her that she owes her
reputation to them, called her ungrateful, and all that
sort of thing; let us see what she says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After reading &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; letter, Mr. Walter laid it down
and began muttering out his thoughts after his usual
fashion. &ldquo;Just as I expected; Lescom has worked on
&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; kind heart till she really feels a sort of necessity
not to leave him so abruptly, and requests me as a personal
favor to grant his request, at least for a time; no,
no, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;&mdash;not unless he will pay you five times as much
as he pays you now, and allow you, besides, to write
much, or little, as you please; but where is Lescom&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
communication? Ruth says he wrote by the same mail&mdash;ah,
here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Walter</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Mrs. Hall, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; informs me that you have engaged
her to write exclusively for the Household Messenger,
and that you will not consent to her writing for
any other publication. Perhaps you are not aware that
<em>I</em> was the first to introduce &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; to the public, and that I
have made her reputation what it is. This being the
case, you will not think it strange that I feel as if I had
some claim on her, so long as I pay her as much as she
can get elsewhere. I need not say to you that The
Standard is in a very flourishing condition; its circulation
having nearly doubled during the past year, and
that my resources are such as to enable me to outbid all
competitors for &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; services, if I choose to take such
a course; but I trust you will at once perceive that the
Standard should be made an exception to your contract,
and permit &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; still to write for it.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Respectfully yours,</span>    <span class="sign1">F. Lescom.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my word,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Walter, when
he had finished Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s letter; &ldquo;if this is not the
coolest piece of egotism and impudence that I ever saw;
but it is no use wasting vitality about it. I will just answer
the letter, and let things take their course; I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the weather-gage of him now, and I&rsquo;ll keep it; he shall
have my reply to digest the first thing in the morning;
I&rsquo;ll write to &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; first, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the designated Thursday, Ruth, according to her
promise, called at the Standard office; something had occurred
to detain Mr. Lescom, so she sat down and opened
Mr. Walter&rsquo;s letter, which lay on the table waiting for
her, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ruth:</span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just finished reading yours and Lescom&rsquo;s letters.
Yours has touched me deeply. It was just like you, but
you know little of the selfishness and humbuggery of some
newspaper publishers; you seem really to think that you
ought to write for Mr. Lescom, if he so much desires it.
This is very good of you, and very amiable, but (forgive
my want of gallantry) very foolish. You can now understand,
if you did not before, why I desired you to sign
the contract by return mail. I was afraid if you went to
Mr. Lescom, or Mr. Tibbetts of the Pilgrim, <em>before signing
it</em>, that they would impose upon your good womanly
heart, and thereby gain an unfair advantage over you. I
wished to surprise you into signing the contract, that I
might have a fair and righteous advantage over them.
And now, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; please to leave the whole matter to me.
I shall not consent to your writing for any paper, unless
the proprietors will give you the full value of your articles&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
they are really worth to them. If things
turn out as I confidently expect they will, from your present
popularity, you will soon be in a state of comparative
independence. On the next page you will find a copy of
my answer to Mr. Lescom&rsquo;s letter. Please keep me informed
of the happenings at your end of the route.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours most truly,</span>    <span class="sign1">John Walter.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth then read Mr. Walter&rsquo;s letter to Mr. Lescom, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">F. Lescom</span>, Esq.
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter in regard to &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is at
hand. You say, that perhaps I am not aware that <em>you</em>
were the first to introduce &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; to the public, and
that <em>you</em> have made her reputation. It is fortunate for
<em>you</em> that she made The Standard the channel of her
first communications to the public. I know this very
well, but I am not aware, nor do I believe, that <em>you</em> have
made her reputation; neither do I think that you believe
this yourself. The truth is simply this; &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is a
genius; her writings, wherever published, would have attracted
attention, and stamped the writer as a person of
extraordinary talent; hence her fame and success, the
fruits of which <em>you</em> have principally reaped. As to
&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; being under any obligations to you, I repudiate
the idea entirely; the &lsquo;obligation&rsquo; is all on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
side. <em>She</em> has made &lsquo;The Standard,&rsquo; instead of you
making <em>her</em> reputation. Her genius has borne its name
to England, Scotland, Ireland,&mdash;wherever the English
language is spoken,&mdash;and raised it from an obscure
provincial paper to a widely-known journal. You say
that you are wealthy, and can pay as much as anybody
for &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; services; I wonder this has never occurred
to you before, especially as she has informed
you frequently how necessitous were her circumstances.
You also inform me that the circulation of The
Standard has nearly doubled the past year. This I
can readily believe, since it is something more than a
year since &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; commenced writing for it. In reply
to your declaration, &lsquo;that in case you are driven to compete
for &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; services, you can outbid all competitors,&rsquo;
I have only to say that my contract with her is for
one year; on its expiration, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; will be at liberty to
decide for herself; you will then have an opportunity to
compete for her pen, and enjoy the privilege of exhibiting
your enterprise and liberality.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your ob&rsquo;t servant,</span>    <span class="sign1">John Walter.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth waited some time after reading these letters, for
Mr. Lescom to come in; but, finding he was still unexpectedly
detained, she took a handful of letters, which
the clerk had just received by mail for her, and bent her
steps homeward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER LXXII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> first letter Ruth opened on her return, was a request
from a Professor of some College for her autograph
for himself and some friends; the second, an offer
of marriage from a Southerner, who confessed to one
hundred negroes, &ldquo;but hoped that the strength and ardor
of the attachment with which the perusal of her articles
had inspired him, would be deemed sufficient atonement
for this in her Northern eyes. The frozen North,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;had no claim on such a nature as hers; the sunny South,
the land of magnolias and orange blossoms, the land of
love, <em>should</em> be her chosen home. Would she not smile on
him? She should have a box at the opera, a carriage,
and servants in livery, and the whole heart and soul of
Victor Le Pont.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next was more interesting. It was an offer to
&ldquo;Floy&rdquo; from a publishing house, to collect her newspaper
articles into a volume. They offered to give her so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
much on a copy, or $800 for the copyright. An answer
was requested immediately. In the same mail came
another letter of the same kind from a distant State, also
offering to publish a volume of her articles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; soliloquized Ruth, &ldquo;business is accumulating.
I don&rsquo;t see but I shall have to make a book in
spite of myself; and yet those articles were written under
such disadvantages, would it be <em>wise</em> in me to publish so
soon? But Katy? and $800 copyright money?&rdquo; Ruth
glanced round her miserable, dark room, and at the little
stereotyped bowl of bread and milk that stood waiting
on the table for her supper and Nettie&rsquo;s; $800 <em>copyright
money</em>! it <em>was</em> a temptation; but supposing her book
should prove a hit? and bring double, treble, fourfold
that sum, to go into her publisher&rsquo;s pockets instead of
hers? how provoking! Ruth straightened up, and putting
on a very resolute air, said, &ldquo;No, gentlemen, I will
<em>not</em> sell you my copyright; these autograph letters, and all
the other letters of friendship, love, and business, I am constantly
receiving from strangers, are so many proofs that
I have won the public ear. No, I will not sell my copyright;
I will rather deny myself a while longer, and accept
the per-centage;&rdquo; and so she sat down and wrote her
publishers; but then caution whispered, what if her book
should <em>not</em> sell? &ldquo;Oh, pshaw,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;it <em>shall</em>!&rdquo;
and she brought her little fist down on the table till the
old stone inkstand seemed to rattle out &ldquo;<em>it shall!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, here is another letter, which I have overlooked,&rdquo;
said Ruth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To the distinguished and popular writer, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;I trust you will excuse the liberty I take
in writing you, when you get through with my letter. I
am thus confident of your leniency, because it seems to
me that my case is not only a plain, but an interesting
one. To come to the point, without any circumlocutory
delay, I am a young man with aspirations far above my
station in life. This declaration is perfectly true in some
senses, but not in every sense. My parents and my ancestors
are and were highly respectable people. My
name, as you will see when you come to my signature, is
Reginald Danby. The Danby family, Madam, was
founded by Sir Reginald Danby, who was knighted for
certain gallant exploits on the field of Hastings, in the
year 1066, by William the Conqueror. Sir Reginald
afterward married a Saxon dame, named Edith, the
daughter of a powerful land-owner; hence the Danby
family. All this is of very little consequence, and I only
mention it in a sort of incidental way, to show you that
my declaration in regard to the respectability of my
family is true, and fortified by unimpeachable historical
evidence; and I will here remark, that you will always
find any assertion of mine as well sustained, by copious
and irrefragable proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The respectability of our family being thus settled,
I come back to an explanation of what I mean by my
&lsquo;having aspirations above my station in life.&rsquo; It is this:
I am poor. My family, though once wealthy, is now impoverished.
The way this state of things came about,
was substantially as follows: My grandfather, who was a
strong-minded, thrifty gentleman, married into a poetical
family. His wife was the most poetical member of said
family; much of her poetry is still extant; it never was
published, because in those days publishers were not as
enterprising as they are now. We value these manuscripts
very highly; still I should be willing to send you
some of them for perusal, in case you will return them
and pay the postage both ways, my limited means not
permitting me to share that pleasure with you. As I
have intimated, my grandmother reveled in poetry.
She doated on Shakspeare, and about three months before
my father&rsquo;s birth, she went to a theatre to witness
the performance of &lsquo;The Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rsquo;
She was enchanted! and, with characteristic decision, resolved
to commit the entire play to memory. This resolution
she executed with characteristic pertinacity, notwithstanding
frequent and annoying interruptions, from
various causes entirely beyond her control. She finished
committing this immortal poem to memory, the very
night my father was born. Time rolled on; my father, as
he grew up, exhibited great flightiness of character, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
instability of purpose, the result, undoubtedly, of his
mother&rsquo;s committing &lsquo;The Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;
to memory under the circumstances which I have detailed.
My father, owing to this unfortunate development
of character, proved inadequate to the management
of his estate, or, indeed, of any business whatever, and
hence our present pecuniary embarrassments. Before
quitting this painful branch of my subject, it will doubtless
gratify you to have me state, that, inasmuch as my
father married a woman of phlegmatic temperament, and
entirely unpoetical mind, the balance of character has
been happily restored to our family, so there is no fear
for me. I am thus particular in my statements, because
I have a high regard for truth, and for veracity, for accuracy
in the <em>minutest</em> things; a phase of character which
may be accounted for from the fact, that I have just gone
through a severe and protracted course of mathematics.
These preliminaries being thus fairly before you, I now
come to the immediate topic of my letter, <abbr class="nc" title="namely">viz.</abbr>: I wish to
go through College; I have not the means. I wish you
to help me. You are probably rich; I hope you are with
all my heart. You must be able to command a high
salary, and a great deal of influence. I don&rsquo;t ask you to
lend me the money out of hand. What I propose is
this: I will furnish you the subject for a splendid and
thrilling story, founded on facts in the history of our
family; the Danby family. In this book, my grandmother&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
poetry would probably read to advantage; if so,
it would be a great saving, as her writings are voluminous.
Your book would be sure to have a large sale,
and the profits would pay my expenses at College, and
perhaps leave a large surplus. This surplus should be
yours, and I would also agree to pay back the sum used
by me from my first earnings after graduation. I have
thought over this matter a great deal, and the foregoing
strikes me as the only way in which this thing can be
done. If you can devise a better plan, I will of course
gladly adopt it. I am not at all opinionated, but am always
glad to listen to anything reasonable. Please let
me hear from you as soon as possible, and believe me
truly your friend and admirer,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Tibbetts</span>, the editor of &ldquo;The Pilgrim,&rdquo; having
returned from the country, Ruth went to the Pilgrim
office to get copies of several of her articles, which
she had taken no pains to keep, never dreaming of republishing
them in book form.</p>

<p>Mr. Tibbetts was sitting at his editorial desk, looking
over a pile of manuscript. Ruth made known her errand,
and also the fact of her being about to publish her book.
He handed her a chair, and drawing another in front
of her, said very stiffly, &ldquo;My partner, Mr. Elder, Mrs.
Hall, has astonished me by the information that you have
very suddenly decided to withdraw from us, who first
patronized you, and to write for the &lsquo;Household Messenger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;I considered it my duty to avail
myself of that increase of salary. My circumstances
have been exceedingly straitened. I have two little ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
dependent on my exertions, and <em>their</em> future, as well as
my own, to look to. You have often told me that you
already paid me all you could afford, so it was useless to
ask you for more; beside, the contract I have accepted,
obliged me to decline or accept it by return of mail, without
communicating its contents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see&mdash;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts, growing very
red in the face, and pushing back his chair; &ldquo;it is always
the way young writers treat those who have made their
reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps <em>your</em> making my reputation, may be a question
open to debate,&rdquo; answered Ruth, stung by his tone;
&ldquo;I feel this morning, however, disinclined to discuss the
question; so, if you please, we will waive it. You have
always told me that you were constantly beset by the
most talented contributors for patronage, so that of course
you will not find it difficult to supply my place, when I
leave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you shall <em>not</em> leave,&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts, turning
very pale about the mouth, and closing his lips firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Shall not!</em>&rdquo; repeated Ruth, rising, and standing erect
before him. &ldquo;<em>Shall</em> not, Mr. Tibbetts? I have yet to
learn that I am not free to go, if I choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are <em>not</em>,&rdquo; said Mr. Tibbetts; &ldquo;that is a
little mistake of yours, as I will soon convince you. Discontinue
writing for &lsquo;The Pilgrim,&rsquo; and I will immediately
get out a cheap edition of your articles, and spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the sale of your book;&rdquo; and he folded his arms, and faced
Ruth as if he would say, &ldquo;Now writhe if you like; I have
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth smiled derisively, then answered in a tone so low
that it was scarcely audible, &ldquo;Mr. Tibbetts, you have
mistaken your auditor. I am not to be frightened, or
threatened, or <em>insulted</em>,&rdquo; said she, turning toward the
door. &ldquo;Even had I not myself the spirit to defy you, as
I now do, for I will never touch pen to paper again for
&lsquo;The Pilgrim,&rsquo; you could not accomplish your threat; for
think you my publishers will tamely fold their arms, and
see <em>their</em> rights infringed? No, sir, you have mistaken
both them and me;&rdquo; and Ruth moved toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tibbetts, placing his hand on
the latch; &ldquo;when you see a paragraph in print that will
sting your proud soul to the quick, know that John Tibbetts
has more ways than one of humbling so imperious
a dame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be hardly consistent,&rdquo; replied Ruth, in the
same calm tone, &ldquo;with the thousand-and-one commendatory
notices of &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;&mdash;the boasts you have made of the
almost exclusive right to the <em>valuable services of so bright
a literary star</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will not see such a paragraph in <em>my</em>
paper,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tibbetts. &ldquo;I am aware, most logical
of women, that I stand committed before the public <em>there</em>;
but I have many an editorial friend, scattered over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
country, who would loan me <em>their</em> columns for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;It were a <em>manly</em> act;
but your threat does not move <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my revenge!&rdquo; exclaimed Tibbetts, as the
last fold of Ruth&rsquo;s dress fluttered out the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Those</span> of my readers who are well acquainted with
journalism, know that some of our newspapers, nominally
edited by the persons whose names appear as
responsible in that capacity, <em>seldom</em>, perhaps <em>never</em> contain
an article from their pen, the whole paper being &ldquo;made
up&rdquo; by some obscure individual, with more brains than
pennies, whose brilliant paragraphs, metaphysical essays,
and racy book reviews, are attributed (and tacitly fathered)
by the comfortably-fed gentlemen who keep
these, their factotums, in some garret, just one degree
above starving point. In the city, where board is expensive,
and single gentlemen are &ldquo;taken in and done for,&rdquo;
under many a sloping attic roof are born thoughts which
should win for their originators fame and independence.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Gates, a gentlemanly, slender, scholar-like-looking
person, held this nondescript, and unrecognized
relation to the Irving Magazine; the nominal editor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Ruth&rsquo;s brother Hyacinth, furnishing but one article a
week, to deduct from the immense amount of labor
necessary to their weekly issue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heigho,&rdquo; said Mr. Gates, dashing down his pen;
&ldquo;four columns yet to make up; I am getting tired of this
drudgery. My friend Seaten told me that he was dining
at a restaurant the other day, when my employer, Mr.
Hyacinth Ellet, came in, and that a gentleman took occasion
to say to Mr. E., how much he admired <em>his</em> article
in the last Irving Magazine, on &lsquo;City Life.&rsquo; <em>His</em> article!
it took me one of the hottest days this season, in
this furnace of a garret, with the beaded drops standing
on my suffering forehead, to write that article, which, by
the way, has been copied far and wide. His article! and
the best of the joke is (Seaten says) the cool way in
which Ellet thanked him, and pocketed all the credit of it!
But what&rsquo;s this? here&rsquo;s a note from the very gentleman
himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Gates</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have noticed that you have several times scissorized
from the exchanges, articles over the signature of
&lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; and inserted them in our paper. It is my wish
that all articles bearing that signature should be excluded
from our paper, and that no allusion be made to her,
in any way or shape, in the columns of the Irving Magazine.
As you are in our business confidence, I may say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that the writer is a sister of mine, and that it would
annoy and mortify me exceedingly to have the fact
known; and it is my express wish that you should not,
hereafter, in any way, aid in circulating her articles.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,</span>    <span class="sign1">Hyacinth Ellet.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said Gates; &ldquo;<em>his</em> sister?
why don&rsquo;t he want her to write? I have cut out every
article of hers as fast as they appeared; confounded good
they are, too, and I call myself a judge; they are better,
at any rate, than half our paper is filled with. This is
all very odd&mdash;it stimulates my curiosity amazingly&mdash;<em>his</em>
sister? married or unmarried, maid, wife, or widow?
She can&rsquo;t be poor when he&rsquo;s so well off; (gave $100 for
a vase which struck his fancy yesterday, at Martini&rsquo;s.)
I don&rsquo;t understand it. &lsquo;Annoy and mortify him exceedingly;&rsquo;
what <em>can</em> he mean? I must get at the bottom of
that; she is becoming very popular, at any rate; her
pieces are traveling all over the country&mdash;and here is
one, to my mind, as good as anything <em>he</em> ever wrote.
Ha! ha! perhaps that&rsquo;s the very idea now&mdash;perhaps he
wants to be the only genius in the family. Let him! if
he can; if she don&rsquo;t win an enviable name, and in a very
short time too, I shall be mistaken. I wish I knew something
about her. Hyacinth is a heartless dog&mdash;pays me
principally in fine speeches; and because I am not in a
position just now to speak my mind about it. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
he takes me for the pliant tool I appear. By Jupiter! it
makes my blood boil; but let me get another and better
offer, Mr. Ellet, and see how long I will write articles for
you to father, in this confounded hot garret. &lsquo;<em>His</em> sister!&rsquo;
I will inquire into that. I&rsquo;ll bet a box of cigars
she writes for daily bread&mdash;Heaven help her, if she does,
poor thing!&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard enough, as I know, for a <em>man</em> to
be jostled and snubbed round in printing-offices. Well,
well, it&rsquo;s no use wondering, I must go to work; what a
pile of books here is to be reviewed! wonder who
reads all the books? Here is Uncle Sam&rsquo;s Log House.
Mr. Ellet writes me that I must simply announce the
book without comment, for fear of offending southern
subscribers. The word &lsquo;slave&rsquo; I know has been tabooed
in our columns this long while, for the same reason.
Here are poems by Lina Lintney&mdash;weak as diluted
water, but the authoress once paid Mr. Ellet a compliment
in a newspaper article, and here is her &lsquo;reward of
merit,&rsquo; (in a memorandum attached to the book, and just
sent down by Mr. Ellet;) &lsquo;give this volume a first-rate
notice.&rsquo; Bah! what&rsquo;s the use of criticism when a man&rsquo;s
opinion can be bought and sold that way? it is an imposition
on the public. There is &lsquo;The Barolds&rsquo; too; I
am to &lsquo;give that a capital notice,&rsquo; because the authoress
introduced Mr. Ellet into fashionable society when a
young man. The grammar in that book would give
Lindley Murray convulsions, and the construction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
sentences drive Blair to a mad-house. Well, a great
deal the dear public know what a book is, by the reviews
of it in this paper. Heaven forgive me the lies I tell
this way on compulsion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The humbuggery of this establishment is only equalled
by the gullibility of the dear public. Once a month,
now, I am ordered to puff every &lsquo;influential paper in the
Union,&rsquo; to ward off attacks on the Irving Magazine, and
the bait takes, too, by Jove. That little &lsquo;Tea-Table Tri-Mountain
Mercury,&rsquo; has not muttered or peeped about
Hyacinth&rsquo;s &lsquo;toadyism when abroad,&rsquo; since Mr. Ellet gave
me orders to praise &lsquo;the typographical and literary excellence
of that widely-circulated paper.&rsquo; Then, there is
the editor of &lsquo;The Bugbear,&rsquo; a cut-and-thrust-bludgeon-pen-and-ink-desperado,
who makes the mincing, aristocratic
Hyacinth quake in his patent-leather boots. I have
orders to toss him a sugar-plum occasionally, to keep his
plebeian mouth shut; something after the French maxim,
&lsquo;always to praise a person for what they <em>are not</em>;&rsquo;&mdash;for
instance, &lsquo;our very <em>gentlemanly</em> neighbor and contemporary,
the discriminating and refined editor of The Bugbear,
whose very readable and spicy paper,&rsquo; <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
Then, there is the <em>religious</em> press. Hyacinth, having rather
a damaged reputation, is anxious to enlist them on his
side, particularly the editor of &lsquo;The Religious Platform.&rsquo;
I am to copy at least one of his editorials once a fortnight,
or in some way call attention to his paper. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
if Hyacinth chooses to puff actresses, and call Mme. &mdash;&mdash; a
&lsquo;splendid personation of womanhood,&rsquo; and praise her
equivocal writings in his paper, which lies on many a
family table to be read by innocent young girls, he
knows the caustic pen of that religious editor will never
be dipped in ink to reprove him. That is the way it is
done. Mutual admiration-society&mdash;bah! I wish <em>I</em> had
a paper. Wouldn&rsquo;t I call things by their right names?
Would I know any sex in books? Would I praise
a book because a woman wrote it? Would I abuse it
for the same reason? Would I say, as one of our most
able editors said not long since to his reviewer, &lsquo;cut
it up root and branch; what right have these women to
set themselves up for authors, and reap literary laurels?&rsquo;
Would I unfairly insert all the adverse notices of a book,
and never copy one in its praise? Would I pass over
the wholesale swindling of some aristocratic scoundrel,
and trumpet in my police report, with heartless comments,
the name of some poor, tempted, starving
wretch, far less deserving of censure, in God&rsquo;s eye, than
myself? Would I have my tongue or my pen tied in
any way by policy, or interest, or clique-ism? No&mdash;sir!
The world never will see a paper till mine is started.
Would I write long descriptions of the wardrobe of foreign
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donnas</i>, who bring their cracked voices, and
reputations to our American market, and &lsquo;occupy suites
of rooms lined with satin, and damask, and velvet,&rsquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
goodness knows what, and give their reception-soirees, at
which they &lsquo;<em>affably notice</em>&rsquo; our toadying first citizens?
By Jupiter! why <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> they be &lsquo;affable&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t
they come over here for our money and patronage?
Who cares how many &lsquo;bracelets&rsquo; Signora &mdash;&mdash; had on,
or whose &lsquo;arm she leaned gracefully upon,&rsquo; or whether
her &lsquo;hair was braided or curled&rsquo;? If, because a lord or a
duke once &lsquo;honored her&rsquo; by insulting her with infamous
proposals, some few brainless Americans choose to deify
her as a goddess, in the name of George Washington and
common sense, let it not be taken as a national exponent.
There are some few Americans left, who prefer ipecac in
hom&oelig;opathic doses.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Hark!</span> Nettie. Go to the door, dear,&rdquo; said Ruth,
&ldquo;some one knocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a strange gentleman, mamma,&rdquo; whispered Nettie,
&ldquo;and he wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth bowed as the stranger entered. She could not
recollect that she had ever seen him before, but he looked
very knowing, and, what was very provoking, seemed to
enjoy her embarrassment hugely. He regarded Nettie,
too, with a very scrutinizing look, and seemed to devour
everything with the first glance of his keen, searching eye.
He even seemed to listen to the whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir of
the odd strange lodger in the garret overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect you,&rdquo; said Ruth, hesitating, and
blushing slightly; &ldquo;you have the advantage of me, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you and I have been writing to each other,
for a week or more,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, with a good-humored
smile; &ldquo;you have even signed a contract, entitling
me to your pen-and-ink services.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Walter?&rdquo; said Ruth, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Walter, &ldquo;I had business this way,
and I could not come here without finding you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;I was just wishing that
I had some head wiser than mine, to help me decide on a
business matter which came up two or three days ago.
Somehow I don&rsquo;t feel the least reluctance to bore you
with it, or a doubt that your advice will not be just the
thing; but I shall not stop to dissect the philosophy of
that feeling, lest in grasping at the shadow, I should lose
the substance,&rdquo; said she, smiling.</p>

<p>While Ruth was talking, Mr. Walter&rsquo;s keen eye
glanced about the room, noting its general comfortless
appearance, and the little bowl of bread and milk that
stood waiting for their supper. Ruth observed this, and
blushed deeply. When she looked again at Mr. Walter,
his eyes were glistening with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, my darling,&rdquo; said he to Nettie, trying to
hide his emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; answered Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will, my dear, because I am your mamma&rsquo;s
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Katy&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; asked Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my <em>sister</em> Katy; she can&rsquo;t live here, because we
don&rsquo;t have supper enough; pretty soon mamma will earn
more supper, won&rsquo;t you mamma? Shan&rsquo;t you be glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
when Katy comes home, and we all have enough to eat?&rdquo;
said the child to Mr. Walter.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter pressed his lips to the child&rsquo;s forehead
with a low &ldquo;Yes, my darling;&rdquo; and then placed his watch
chain and seals at her disposal, fearing Ruth might be
painfully affected by her artless prattle.</p>

<p>Ruth then produced the different publishers&rsquo; offers she
had received for her book, and handed them to Mr.
Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, with a gratified smile, &ldquo;I am not at
all surprised; but what are you going to reply?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is my answer,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;<abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr> provided
your judgment endorses it. I am a novice in such matters,
you know, but I cannot help thinking, Mr. Walter,
that my book will be a success. You will see that I have
acted upon that impression, and refused to sell my copyright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t approve it?&rdquo; said she, looking a little confused,
as Mr. Walter bent his keen eyes on her, without
replying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do though,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was only thinking how
excellent a substitute strong common-sense may be for
experience. Your answer is brief, concise, sagacious, and
business-like; I endorse it unhesitatingly. It is just what
I should have advised you to write. You are correct in
thinking that your book will be popular, and wise in
keeping the copyright in your own hands. In how incredibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
short a time you have gained a literary reputation,
Floy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ruth, smiling, &ldquo;it is all like a
dream to me;&rdquo; and then the smile faded away, and she
shuddered involuntarily as the recollection of all her
struggles and sufferings came vividly up to her remembrance.</p>

<p>Swiftly the hours fled away as Mr. Walter, with a
brother&rsquo;s freedom, questioned Ruth as to her past life and
drew from her the details of her eventful history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, the morning dawneth,&rdquo; said he in a subdued
tone, as he pressed Ruth&rsquo;s hand, and bade her a
parting good-night.</p>

<p>Ruth closed the door upon Mr. Walter&rsquo;s retreating
figure, and sat down to peruse the following letters, which
had been sent her to Mr. Walter&rsquo;s care, at the Household
Messenger office.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. or Miss &lsquo;Floy:&rsquo;</span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Permit me to address you on a subject which lies
near my heart, which is, in fact, a subject of pecuniary
importance to the person now addressing you. My story
is to me a painful one; it would doubtless interest you;
were it written and published, it would be a thrilling
tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some months since I had a lover whom I adored, and
who said he adored me. But as Shakspeare has said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
&lsquo;The course of true love never did run smooth;&rsquo; ours
soon became an up-hill affair, my lover proved false,
ceased his visits, and sat on the other side of the meeting-house.
On my writing to him and desiring an explanation,
he insultingly replied, that I was not what his fancy
had painted me. Was that <em>my</em> fault? false, fickle, ungenerous
man! But I was not thus to be deceived and
shuffled off. No; I employed the best counsel in the
State and commenced an action for damages, determined
to get some balm for my wounded feelings; but owing
to the premature death of my principal witness, I lost
the case and the costs were heavy. The excitement and
worry of the trial brought on a fever, and I found myself
on my recovery, five hundred dollars in debt; I intend
to pay every cent of this, but how am I to pay it?
My salary for teaching school is small and it will take
me many years. I want you, therefore, to assist me by
writing out my story and giving me the book. I will
furnish all the facts, and the story, written out by your
magic pen, would be a certain success. A publisher in
this city has agreed to publish it for me if you will write
it. I could then triumph over the villain who so basely
deceived me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please send me an early answer, as the publisher referred
to is in a great hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing, &ldquo;my bump of invention
will be entirely useless, if my kind friends keep on furnishing
me with subjects at this rate. Here is letter
No. 2.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dog Fido is dead. He was a splendid Newfoundland,
black and shaggy; father gave $10 for him when he
was a pup. We all loved him dearly. He was a prime dog,
could swim like a fish. The other morning we found him
lying motionless on the door-step. Somebody had poisoned
poor Fido. I cried all that day, and didn&rsquo;t play marbles
for a whole week. He is buried in the garden, and I want
you to write an epithalamium about him. My brother
John, who is looking over my shoulder, is laughing like
everything; he says &rsquo;t is an epitaph, not an epithalamium
that I want, just as if <em>I</em> didn&rsquo;t know what I want? John is
just home from college, and thinks he knows everything.
It is my dog, and I&rsquo;ll fix his tombstone just as I like. Fellows
in round jackets are not always fools. Send it along
quick, please, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;; the stone-cutter is at work now.
What a funny way they cut marble, don&rsquo;t they? (with
sand and water.) Johnny Weld and I go there every recess,
to see how they get on with the tombstone. Don&rsquo;t
stick in any Latin or Greek, now, in your epithalamium.
Our John cannot call for a glass of water without lugging
in one or the other of them; I&rsquo;m sick as death of it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
wonder if I shall be such a fool when I go to college. You
ought to be glad you are a woman, and don&rsquo;t have to go.
Don&rsquo;t forget Fido, now. Remember, he was six years old,
black, shaggy, with a white spot on his forehead, and rather
a short-ish tail&mdash;a prime dog, I tell <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Billy Sands.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It is a harrowing case, Billy,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;but I shall
have to let Fido pass; now for letter No. 3.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I address a stranger, and yet <em>not</em> a stranger, for I
have read your heart in the pages of your books. In
these I see sympathy for the poor, the sorrowing, and the
dependent; I see a tender love for helpless childhood.
Dear &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; I am an orphan, and that most wretched of
all beings, a loving, but unloved wife. The hour so
dreaded by all maternity draws near to me. It has been
revealed to me in dreams that I shall not survive it.
&lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; will you be a mother to my babe? I cannot tell
you why I put this trust in one whom I have only known
through her writings, but something assures me it will be
safe with you; that you only can fill my place in the little
heart that this moment is pulsating beneath my own.
Oh, do not refuse me. There are none in the wide world
to dispute the claim I would thus transfer to you. Its
father&mdash;but of him I will not speak; the wine-cup is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
rival. Write me speedily. I shall die content if your
arms receive my babe.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours affectionately,&rdquo;</span>    <span class="sign1">Mary Andrews.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mary! that letter must be answered,&rdquo; said
Ruth, with a sigh;&mdash;&ldquo;ah, here is one more letter.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Miss</span>, or <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span>, or <span class="smcap">Madam Floy</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose by this time you have become so inflated
that the honest truth would be rather unpalatable to you;
nevertheless, I am going to send you a few plain words.
The rest of the world flatters you&mdash;I shall do no such
thing. You have written tolerably, all things considered,
but you violate all established rules of composition, and
are as lawless and erratic as a comet. You may startle
and dazzle, but you are fit only to throw people out of
their orbits. Now and then, there&rsquo;s a gleam of something
like reason in your writings, but for the most part
they are unmitigated trash&mdash;false in sentiment&mdash;unrhetorical
in expression; in short, were you my daughter,
which I thank a good Providence you are not, I should
box your ears, and keep you on a bread and water diet
till you improved. That you can do better, if you will,
I am very sure, and that is why I take the pains to find
fault, and tell you what none of your fawning friends will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not a genius&mdash;no, madam, not by many removes;
Shakspeare was a genius&mdash;Milton was a genius&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
author of &lsquo;History of the Dark Ages,&rsquo; which has
reached its fifteenth edition, was a genius&mdash;(you may not
know you have now the honor of being addressed by
him;) no, madam, you are not a genius, nor have I yet
seen a just criticism of your writings; they are all either
over-praised, or over-abused; you have a certain sort of
talent, and that talent, I grant you, is peculiar; but a
genius&mdash;no, no, Mrs., or Miss, or Madam Floy&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
approach genius, though I am not without a hope that, if
you are not spoiled by injudicious, sycophantic admirers,
you may yet produce something creditable; although I
candidly confess, that it is my opinion, that the <em>female</em>
mind is incapable of producing anything which may be
strictly termed <em>literature</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Have</span> you ever submitted your head to a phrenological
examination?&rdquo; asked Mr. Walter, as he made
a call on Ruth, the next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;I believe that much more is to be
told by the expression of people&rsquo;s faces than by the
bumps upon their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you a woman of sense!&rdquo; replied Mr. Walter.
&ldquo;Will you have your head examined to please me? I
should like to know what Prof. Finman would say of you,
before I leave town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind going,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;provided
the Professor does not know his subject, and I see
that there&rsquo;s fair play,&rdquo; said she, laughing; &ldquo;but I warn
you, beforehand, that I have not the slightest faith in the
science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth tied on her bonnet, and was soon demurely seated
in the Professor&rsquo;s office, with her hair about her shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Mr. Walter sat at a table near, prepared to take notes in
short-hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have an unusually even head, madam,&rdquo; said the
Professor. &ldquo;Most of the faculties are fully developed.
There are not necessarily any extremes in your character,
and when you manifest them, they are more the result
of circumstances than the natural tendency of the mind.
You are of a family where there was more than ordinary
unity in the connubial relations; certainly in the marriage,
if not in the after-life of your parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your physiology indicates a predominance of the
nervous temperament; this gives unusual activity of
mind, and furnishes the capacity for a great amount of
enjoyment or suffering. Few enjoy or suffer with such
intensity as you do. Your happiness or misery depends
very much on surrounding influences and circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have, next, a predominance of the vital temperament,
which gives great warmth and ardor to your mind,
and enables you to enjoy physical comfort and the luxuries
of life in a high degree. Your muscular system is
rather defective; there not being enough to furnish real
strength and stamina of constitution. Although you may
live to be aged, you will not be able to put forth such
vigorous efforts as you could do, were the motive or
muscular temperament developed in a higher degree.
You may think I am mistaken on this point, but I am not.
You have an immense power of will, are energetic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
forcible in overcoming obstacles, would display more
than ordinary fortitude in going through trials and difficulties,
and possess a tenacity of purpose and perseverence
in action, which enable you to do whatever you are
determined upon doing; but these are <em>mental</em> characteristics
not <em>physical</em>, and your mind often tires out your
body, and leaves you in a state of muscular prostration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your phrenology indicates an unusual degree of respect
and regard for whatever you value as superior.
You never trifle with superiority. I do not mean conventional
superiority or bombastic assumption, but what
you really believe to be good and noble. As a child,
you were very obedient, unless your sense of justice
(which is very strong) was violated. In such a case, it
was somewhat difficult for you to yield either ready or
implicit obedience. You are religiously disposed. You
are also characterized by a strong belief in Divine influences,
providences, and special interpositions from on
high. You are more than ordinarily spiritual in the tone
of your mind. You see, or think you see, the hand of
Providence in things as they transpire. You are also
very conscientious, and this, combined with your firmness,
which is quite strong, and supported by your faith
in Providence, gives you a striking degree of what is
called moral courage. When you believe you are right,
there is no moving you; and your friends probably
think that you are sometimes very obstinate; but let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
them convince your intellect and satisfy your conscience,
and you will be quite tractable, more especially as you
are characterized by unusual sympathy and tenderness
of feeling. You too easily catch the spirit of others,&mdash;of
those you love and are interested in, and feel as they feel,
and enjoy or suffer as they do. You have very strong
hope with reference to immortality and future happiness.
When a young girl, you were remarkably abounding
in your spiritual anticipations of what you were going to
be as a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You possess an extraordinary degree of perseverance,
but have not a marked degree of prompt decision. After
you have <em>decided</em>, you act energetically, and are more
sure to finish what you commence, than you are ready to
begin a new enterprise. You are decidedly cautious,
anxious, mindful of results, and desire to avoid difficulty
and danger. You take all necessary care, and provide
well for the future. Your cautiousness is, in fact, too active.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You place a very high value on your character; are
particularly sensitive to reproach; cannot tolerate scolding,
or being found fault with. You can be quite reserved,
dignified, and even haughty. You are usually
kind and affable, but are capable of strong feelings of
resentment. You make few enemies by your manner of
speaking and acting. You are uniform in the manifestation
of your affections. You do not form attachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
readily, or frequently; on the contrary, you are quite
particular in the choice of your friends, and are very devoted
to those to whom you become attached. You
manifested these same traits when a child, in the selection
of playmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your love is a mental love&mdash;a regard for the mind,
rather than the person of the individual. You appreciate
the masculine mind as such, rather than the physical
form. You have a high regard for chivalry, manliness,
and intellectuality in man, but you also demand goodness,
and religious devotion. It would give you pain to
hear a friend speak lightly of what you consider sacred
things; and I hardly think you would ever love a man
whom you <em>knew</em> to be irreligious. Your maternal feelings
are very strong. You are much interested in children.
You sympathize with and understand them perfectly.
You are, yourself, quite youthful in the tone of
your mind; much younger than many not half your age.
This, taken in connection with your sympathy with, and
appreciation of, the character of children, enables you to
entertain them, and win them to your wishes; but,
at times, you are too anxious about their welfare. You
are strongly attached to place, and are intensely patriotic.
You believe in Plymouth Rock and Bunker Hill. You
are not content without a home of your own; and yet,
in a home of your own, you would not be happy without
pleasant surroundings and associations, scenery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
such things as would facilitate improvement and enjoyment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very fond of poetry and beauty, wherever you
see it,&mdash;of oratory, sculpture, painting, scenery, flowers,
and beautiful sentiments. You must have everything
nice; you cannot tolerate anything coarse or gross. The
world is hardly finished nice enough for you. You are
too exacting in this respect. The fact is, you are made
of finer clay than most of us. You are particular with
reference to your food, and not easily suited. You must
have that which is clean and nice, or none. Whatever
you do, such as embroidery, drawing, painting, needlework,
or any artistic performance, is very nicely done.
Your constructiveness is very large. You can plan well;
can lay out work for others to advantage; can cut out
things, and invent new and tasteful fashions. Your appreciation
of colors is very nice; you can arrange and
blend them harmoniously, in dress, in decoration of
rooms, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> You could make a slim wardrobe, and a
small stock of furniture, go a great way, and get up a
better looking parlor with a few hundred dollars, than
some could with as many thousands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You exhibit a predominance of the reflective intellect
over the perceptive, and are characterized for thought,
judgment, and the power to comprehend ideas, more than
for your knowledge of things, facts, circumstances or conditions
of things. You remember and understand what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
you read, better than what you see and hear; still, you
are more than ordinarily observant. In passing along the
street, you would see much more than people in general,
and would be able to describe very accurately the style,
execution and quality of whatever you saw. You have a
pliable mind. You love acting, and would excel as an
actress. You have great powers of sarcasm. You enjoy
fun highly, but it must be of the right kind. You
will tolerate nothing low. You are precise in the use of
language, and are a good verbal critic. You ought to be
a good conversationist, and a forcible and spicy writer.
In depicting character and describing scenes, you would
be apt to display many of the characteristics which Dickens
exhibits. Your aptness in setting-forth, your keen
sense of the ludicrous, your great powers of amplification,
and the intensity of your feelings, would enable
you to produce a finely wrought out, and exquisitely colored
picture. You have also an active sense of music;
are almost passionately fond of that kind which is agreeable
to you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have more than ordinary fortitude, but are lacking
in the influences of combativeness. Your temper
comes to a crisis too soon; you cannot keep angry long
enough to scold. You dislike contention. You read the
minds of others almost instantaneously; and at once form
a favorable or unfavorable impression of a person. You
are secretive, and disposed to conceal your feelings; are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
anxious to avoid unnecessary exposure of your faults, and
know how to appear to the best advantage. You have a
good faculty of entertaining others, but can be with persons
a long time without their becoming acquainted with
you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dream things true; truth comes to you in
dreams, forewarnings, admonitions, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are liable to be a very happy, or very unhappy,
woman. The worst feature of your whole character,
or tone of mind, arises from the influence of your education.
Too much attention was paid to your mind, and
not enough to your body. You were brought forward
too early, and made a woman of too soon. Ideas too
big for you were put into your mind, and it was not occupied
enough about the ordinary affairs of life. This
renders your mind too morbid and sensitive, and unfits
you for encountering the disagreeable phases of life. You
can endure disagreeable things with martyr-like firmness,
but not with martyr-like resignation. They prey both
on your mind and body, and wear heavily upon your
spirit. You feel as though some one must go forward
and clear the way for you to enjoy yourself; and if by
any reverse of fortune, you have ever been thrown on
your own resources, and forced to take care of yourself,
you had to learn some lessons, which should have been
taught you before you were sixteen years old. But in
the general tone of your mind, in elevation of thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
feeling, sympathy, sentiment, and religious devotion, you
rank far above most of us, above many who are, perhaps,
better prepared to discharge the ordinary duties of
life. In conclusion, I will remark, that very much might
be said with reference to the operations of your mind,
for we seldom find the faculties so fully developed, or the
powers so versatile as in your case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, with a triumphant air, as
they left the Professor&rsquo;s office, &ldquo;well, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; what do
you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we have received our $2 worth in flattery,&rdquo;
replied Ruth, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not a whit of exaggeration in it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Walter. &ldquo;The Professor has hit you off to the life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it would be wasting breath to
discuss the point with you,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;so I will merely
remark that I was highly amused when he said I
should make a good actress. I have so often been told
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True; Comedy would be your forte, though. How
is it that when looking about for employment, you never
contemplated the stage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Mr. Walter, that we May-Flower
descendents hold the theatre in abhorrence. For myself,
however, I can speak from observation, being determined
not to take that doctrine on hearsay; I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
witnessed many theatrical performances, and they only
served to confirm my prejudices against the institution.
I never should dream of such a means of support. Your
Professor made one great mistake; for instance,&rdquo; said
Ruth, &ldquo;he thinks my physique is feeble. Do you know
that I can walk longer and faster than any six women in
the United States?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Walter, &ldquo;I know all about that; I
have known you, under a strong impetus, do six days&rsquo;
work in one, and I have known you after it prostrated
with a nervous headache which defied every attempt at
mitigation. He is right, Ruth, your mind often tires
your body completely out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing, your Professor says I do not like to be
found fault with; now this is not quite true. I do not object,
for instance, to <em>fair</em> criticism. I quarrel with no one
who denies to my writings literary merit; they have a
right to hold such an opinion, a right to express it. But
to have one&rsquo;s book reviewed on hearsay, by persons who
never looked between the covers, or to have isolated paragraphs
circulated, with words italicized, so that gross
constructions might be forced upon the reader, which the
author never could dream of; then to have paragraphs
taken up in that state, credited to you, and commented
upon by horrified moralists,&mdash;that is what I call unfair
play, Mr. Walter. When my sense of justice is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
wounded, I do feel keenly, and I have sometimes thought
if such persons knew the suffering that such thoughtlessness,
to baptize it by the most charitable name, may
cause a woman, who must either weep in silence over
such injustice, or do violence to her womanly nature by a
public contention for her rights, such outrages would be
much less frequent. It seems to me,&rdquo; said she earnestly,
&ldquo;were I a man, it would be so sweet to use my powers
to defend the defenceless. It would seem to me so impossible
to use that power to echo the faintest rumor
adverse to a woman, or to keep cowardly silence in
the shrugging, sneering, slanderer&rsquo;s presence, when a bold
word of mine for the cause of right, might close his dastard
lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Ruth, you speak like an oracle. Your sentiments
are excellent, but I hope you are not so unsophisticated
as to expect ever to see them put in universal practice.
Editors are but men, and in the editorial profession,
as in all other professions, may be found very shabby specimens
of humanity. A petty, mean-spirited fellow, is
seldom improved by being made an editor of; on the contrary,
his pettiness, and meanness, are generally intensified.
It is a pity that such unscrupulous fellows should be able
to bring discredit on so intelligent and honorable a class
of the community. However,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;we
all are more or less responsible, for if the better class of
editors refrained from copying abusive paragraphs, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
circulation would be confined to a kennel class whose
opinion is a matter of very little consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Ruth,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, after walking
on in silence a few rods, &ldquo;how is it, in these days of female
preachers, that you never contemplated the pulpit
or lecture-room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the lecture-room,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;I had as
great a horror of that, as far as I myself am concerned,
as the profession of an actress; but not long since I
heard the eloquent Miss Lucy Stone one evening, when it
really did appear to me that those Bloomers of hers had
a mission! Still, I never could put them on. And as to
the pulpit, I have too much reverence for that to think of
putting my profane foot in it. It is part of my creed that
a congregation can no more repay a conscientious, God-fearing,
devoted minister, than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> can help &lsquo;expressing your <em>real</em> sentiments,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Mr. Walter, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied Ruth; &ldquo;but people who live
in glass houses should not throw stones. But here we
are at home; don&rsquo;t you hear the &lsquo;whir&mdash;whir&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">And</span> now our heroine had become a regular business
woman. She did not even hear the whir&mdash;whir of
the odd lodger in the attic. The little room was littered
with newspapers, envelopes, letters opened and unopened,
answered and waiting to be answered. One minute
she might be seen sitting, pen in hand, trying, with knit
brows, to decipher some horrible cabalistic printer&rsquo;s
mark on the margin of her proof; then writing an article
for Mr. Walter, then scribbling a business letter to her
publishers, stopping occasionally to administer a sedative
to Nettie, in the shape of a timely quotation from Mother
Goose, or to heal a fracture in a doll&rsquo;s leg or arm. Now
she was washing a little soiled face, or smoothing little
rumpled ringlets, replacing a missing shoe-string or pinafore
button, then wading through the streets while Boreas
contested stoutly for her umbrella, with parcels and letters
to the post-office, (for Ruth must be her own servant,)
regardless of gutters or thermometers, regardless of
jostling or crowding. What cared she for all these, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Katy would soon be back&mdash;poor little patient, suffering
Katy? Ruth felt as if wings were growing from her
shoulders. She never was weary, or sleepy, or hungry.
She had not the slightest idea, till long after, what an incredible
amount of labor she accomplished, or how her
<em>mother&rsquo;s heart</em> was goading her on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pressing business that Mis. Hall must have,&rdquo; said her
landlady, with a sneer, as Ruth stood her dripping umbrella
in the kitchen sink. &ldquo;Pressing business, running
round to offices and the like of that, in such a storm as
this. You wouldn&rsquo;t catch <em>me</em> doing it if I was a widder.
I hope I&rsquo;d have more regard for appearances. I don&rsquo;t
understand all this flying in and out, one minute up in
her room, the next in the street, forty times a day, and
letters by the wholesale. It will take me to inquire
into it. It may be all right, hope it is; but of course I
like to know what is going on in my house. This Mis.
Hall is so terrible close-mouthed, I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;ve
thought a dozen times I&rsquo;d like to ask her right straight
out who and what she is, and done with it; but I have
not forgotten that little matter about the pills, and when
I see her, there&rsquo;s something about her, she&rsquo;s civil enough
too, that seems to say, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you cross that chalk-mark,
Sally Waters.&rsquo; I never had lodgers afore like her and
that old Bond, up in the garret. They are as much alike
as two peas. <em>She</em> goes scratch&mdash;scratch&mdash;scratch; <em>he</em>
goes whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir. They haint spoke a word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
one another since that child was sick. It&rsquo;s enough to
drive anybody mad, to have such a mystery in the house.
I can&rsquo;t make head nor tail on&rsquo;t. John, now, he don&rsquo;t care
a rush-light about it; no more he wouldn&rsquo;t, if the top of
the house was to blow off; but there&rsquo;s nothing plagues <em>me</em>
like it, and yet I aint a bit curous nuther. Well, neither
she nor Bond make me any trouble, there&rsquo;s that in it; if
they did I wouldn&rsquo;t stand it. And as long as they both
pay their bills so reg&rsquo;lar, I shan&rsquo;t make a fuss; I <em>should</em>
like to know though what Mis. Hall is about all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Publication day came at last. There was <em>the</em> book.
Ruth&rsquo;s book! Oh, how few of its readers, if it were fortunate
enough to find readers, would know how much of her
own heart&rsquo;s history was there laid bare. Yes, there was
the book. She could recall the circumstances under which
each separate article was written. Little shoeless feet
were covered with the proceeds of this; a little medicine,
or a warmer shawl was bought with that. This was written,
faint and fasting, late into the long night; that composed
while walking wearily to or from the offices where
she was employed. One was written with little Nettie
sleeping in her lap; another still, a mirthful, merry piece,
as an escape-valve for a wretched heartache. Each had its
own little history. Each would serve, in after-days, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
a land-mark to some thorny path of by-gone trouble.
Oh, if the sun of prosperity, after all, should gild these
rugged paths! Some virtues&mdash;many faults&mdash;the book
had&mdash;but God speed it, for little Katy&rsquo;s sake!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, please,&rdquo; said little Nettie, attracted by
the gilt covers, as she reached out her hand for the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you make those pretty pictures, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear&mdash;a gentleman, an artist, made those for
me&mdash;<em>I</em> make pictures with a-b-c&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me one of your pictures, mamma,&rdquo; said Nettie.</p>

<p>Ruth took the child upon her lap, and read her the story
of Gertrude. Nettie listened with her clear eyes fixed
upon her mother&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make her die&mdash;oh, please don&rsquo;t make her die,
mamma,&rdquo; exclaimed the sensitive child, laying her little
hand over her mother&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>Ruth smiled, and improvised a favorable termination
to her story, more suitable to her tender-hearted audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is nice,&rdquo; said Nettie, kissing her mother; &ldquo;when
I get to be a woman shall I write books, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; murmured Ruth, kissing the child&rsquo;s
changeful cheek; &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; murmured she, musingly,
as she turned over the leaves of her book; &ldquo;no
happy woman ever writes. From Harry&rsquo;s grave sprang
&lsquo;Floy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;You</span> have a noble place here,&rdquo; said a gentleman to
Ruth&rsquo;s brother, Hyacinth, as he seated himself on
the piazza, and his eye lingered first upon the velvet lawn,
(with its little clumps of trees) sloping down to the river,
then upon the feathery willows now dipping their light
green branches playfully into the water, then tossing them
gleefully up to the sunlight; &ldquo;a noble place,&rdquo; said he, as
he marked the hazy outline of the cliffs on the opposite
side, and the blue river which laved their base, flecked
with many a snowy sail; &ldquo;it were treason not to be
poetical here; I should catch the infection myself, matter-of-fact
as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that steamer yonder, floating down the
river, Lewis?&rdquo; said Hyacinth. &ldquo;Do you know her?
No? well she is named &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; after my sister, by one
of her literary admirers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash;! <em>your</em> sister? &lsquo;<em>Floy</em>&rsquo;&mdash;your <em>sister</em>! why,
everybody is going mad to know who she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; replied Hyacinth, running his white fingers
through his curls; &ldquo;&lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the deuce didn&rsquo;t you tell a fellow before?
I have wasted more pens, ink, and breath, trying to
find her out, than I can stop to tell you about now, and
here you have kept as mum as a mouse all the time.
What did you do it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, coloring a little, &ldquo;&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;
had an odd fancy for being <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="incognito">incog.</abbr>, and I, being in her confidence,
you know, was on honor to keep her secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she <em>still wishes it kept</em>,&rdquo; said Lewis; &ldquo;so her
publishers, whom I have vainly pumped, tell me. So, as
far as that goes, I don&rsquo;t see why you could not have told
me before just as well as now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hyacinth very suddenly became aware of &ldquo;an odd
craft in the river,&rdquo; and was apparently intensely absorbed
looking at it through his spy-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hyacinth! I say, Hyacinth!&rdquo; said the pertinacious
Lewis, &ldquo;I believe, after all, you are humbugging me.
How <em>can</em> she be your sister? Here&rsquo;s a paragraph in &mdash;&mdash; Sentinel,
saying&mdash;&rdquo; and Lewis drew the paper
from his pocket, unfolded it, and put on his glasses with
distressing deliberation: &ldquo;&lsquo;We understand that &ldquo;Floy,&rdquo;
the new literary star, was in very destitute circumstances
when she first solicited the patronage of the public; often
wandering from one editorial office to another in search
of employment, while wanting the commonest necessaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of life.&rsquo; There, now, how can that be if she is &lsquo;your
sister&rsquo;? and you an editor, too, always patronizing some
new contributor with a flourish of trumpets? Pooh,
man! you are hoaxing;&rdquo; and Lewis jogged him again by
the elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
blandly, &ldquo;but &rsquo;pon my honor, I haven&rsquo;t heard a word
you were saying, I was so intent upon making out that
craft down the river. I&rsquo;m a little afraid of that fog coming
up, Lewis; suppose we join Mrs. Ellet in the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd&mdash;very odd,&rdquo; soliloquized Lewis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try him
again.&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you read the panegyric on &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; in &lsquo;The Inquisitor&rsquo;
of this morning?&rdquo; said Lewis. &ldquo;That paper,
you know, is decidedly the highest literary authority in
the country. It pronounces &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; book to be an &lsquo;unquestionable
work of genius.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hyacinth, &ldquo;I saw it. It is a great
thing, Lewis, for a young writer to be <em>literarily connected</em>;&rdquo;
and Hyacinth pulled up his shirt-collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I understood you just now that nobody knew
she <em>was</em> your sister, when she first published the pieces
that are now collected in that book,&rdquo; said Lewis, with his
characteristic pertinacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that craft again,&rdquo; said Hyacinth; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
make her out, Lewis?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;by Jove,&rdquo; replied Lewis, sarcastically; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
make anything out. I never was so be-fogged in my life;&rdquo;
and he bent a penetrating glance on the masked face before
him. &ldquo;It is past my finding out, at least just now;
but I&rsquo;ve a Yankee tongue in my head, so I don&rsquo;t despair,
with time and perseverance;&rdquo; and Lewis followed Hyacinth
into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confounded disagreeable fellow,&rdquo; soliloquized Hyacinth,
as he handed him over to a knot of ladies in the
drawing-room; &ldquo;very awkward that paragraph; I wish I
had the fellow who wrote it, at pistol-shot distance just
now; well, if I am badgered on the subject of &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo;
poverty, I shall start a paragraph saying, that the story is
only a publisher&rsquo;s trick to make her book sell; by Jove,
they don&rsquo;t corner me; I have got out of worse scrapes
than that before now, by the help of my wits and the
lawyers, but I don&rsquo;t think a paper of any influence would
attack me on that point; I have taken care to secure all
the more prominent ones, long ago, by judicious puffs of
their editors in the Irving Magazine. The only one I
fear is the &mdash;&mdash;, and I will lay an anchor to windward
there this very week, by praising the editor&rsquo;s last stupid
editorial. What an unmitigated donkey that fellow is.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIX.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;How</span> are you, Walter,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewis, extending
his hand; &ldquo;fine day; how goes the world with
you? They say <em>you</em> are a man who dares to &lsquo;hew to
the line, let the chips fly in whose face they will.&rsquo; Now,
I want you to tell me if &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is <em>really</em> a sister of Hyacinth
Ellet, the editor of &lsquo;The Irving Magazine.&rsquo; I cannot
believe it, though he boasted of it to me the other
day, I hear such accounts of her struggles and her
poverty. I cannot see into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very easily understood,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, with
a dark frown on his face; &ldquo;Mr. Hyacinth Ellet has
always had one hobby, namely&mdash;social position. For
that he would sacrifice the dearest friend or nearest relative
he had on earth. His sister was once in affluent circumstances,
beloved and admired by all who knew her.
Hyacinth, at that time, was very friendly, of course; her
husband&rsquo;s wine and horses, and his name on change, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
things which the extravagant Hyacinth knew how to appreciate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hall (&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; husband) was a generous-hearted, impulsive
fellow, too noble himself to see through the specious,
flimsy veil which covered so corrupt a heart as Hyacinth&rsquo;s.
Had he been less trusting, less generous to
him, &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; might not have been left so destitute at his
death. When that event occurred, Hyacinth&rsquo;s regard for
his sister evaporated in a lachrymose obituary notice of
Hall in the Irving Magazine. The very day after his
death, Hyacinth married Julia Grey, or rather married
her fortune. His sister, after seeking in vain to get employment,
driven to despair, at last resorted to her pen,
and applied to Hyacinth, then the prosperous editor of
the Irving Magazine, either to give her employment as a
writer, or show her some way to obtain it. At that time
Hyacinth was constantly boasting of the helping hand
he had extended to young writers in their extremity,
(whom, by the way, he paid in compliments after securing
their articles,) and whom, he was constantly asserting,
had been raised by him from, obscurity to fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lewis, bending eagerly forward; &ldquo;well,
he helped his sister, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did no such thing, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, bringing
his hand down on the table; &ldquo;he did no such thing, sir;
but he wrote her a cool, contemptuous, insulting letter,
denying her all claim to talent, (she had sent him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
specimen articles,) and advising her to seek some unobtrusive
employment, (<em>what</em> employment he did not
trouble himself to name,) and then ignored her existence;
and this, too, when he was squandering money on &lsquo;distressed&rsquo;
actresses, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Lewis, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, she struggled on bravely and single-handed,
with the skeleton Starvation standing by her hearth-stone&mdash;she
who had never known a wish ungratified during
her married life, whose husband&rsquo;s pride in her was only
equalled by his love. She has sunk fainting to the floor
with hunger, that her children might not go supperless
to bed. And now, when the battle is fought and the victory
won, <em>he</em> comes in for a share of the spoils. It is
&lsquo;my sister &ldquo;Floy,&rdquo;&rsquo; and &rsquo;tis <em>his</em> &lsquo;literary reputation which
was the stepping-stone to her celebrity as a writer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To show you how much &lsquo;his reputation has helped
her,&rsquo; I will just state that, not long since, I was dining at
a restaurant near two young men, who were discussing
&lsquo;Floy.&rsquo; One says, &lsquo;Have you read her book?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said the other, with a sneer, &lsquo;nor do I want to; it is
enough for me that Hyacinth Ellet claims her as a sister;
<em>that</em> is enough to damn any woman.&rsquo; Then,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Walter, &ldquo;there was an English paper, the editor
of which, disgusted with Hyacinth&rsquo;s toadyisms, fopperies,
and impudence while abroad, took occasion to cut
up her book (as he acknowledged) because the writer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
said to be Ellet&rsquo;s sister. That is the way <em>his</em> reputation
has helped her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder she is at sword&rsquo;s-point with him,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not at sword&rsquo;s-point with him,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Walter. &ldquo;She simply chooses to retain the position her
family assigned her when she was poor and obscure.
They would not notice her then; she will not accept
their notice now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was the old man, her father, all this time?&rdquo;
said Mr. Lewis, &ldquo;was he alive and in good circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter; &ldquo;and once in awhile
he threw her a dollar, just as one would throw a bone to
a hungry dog, with a &lsquo;begone!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lewis, as he passed out,
&ldquo;what a heartless set.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ruth</span> returned from her daily walk to the Post Office,
one morning, with a bundle of letters, among which
was one from Mr. Walter. Its contents were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sister Ruth</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you are enjoying your triumph half as
much as I? But how should you, since you do not know
of it? Your publishers inform me that orders are pouring
in for your book faster than they can supply them.
What do you think of that? &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; you have made a
decided hit; how lucky that you had the foresight to hold
on to your copyright. $800 will not be a circumstance to
the little fortune you are going to make. Your success
is glorious; but I don&rsquo;t believe you are half as proud of
it as I am.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, I know of what you are thinking as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
as if I were by your side. &rsquo;Tis of the little exile, &rsquo;tis of
Katy. You would fly directly to bring her home. Can
I be of any service to you in doing this? Business takes
me your way day after to-morrow. Can you curb your
impatience to see her till then? If so, I will accompany
you. Please write me immediately.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span>    <span class="sign1">John Walter.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.&nbsp;S.&mdash;I send you a batch of letters, which came by
this morning&rsquo;s mail, directed to &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; office of the
Household Messenger.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth tossed the &ldquo;batch of letters&rdquo; down unopened,
and sprang to her feet; she tossed up Nettie; she kissed
the astonished child till she was half strangled; she
laughed, she cried, and then she sat down with her forehead
in both her hands, for a prolonged reverie.</p>

<p>What <em>good</em> news about the book! How could she
wait two days before she brought back Katy! And yet
it would be a happy thing, that Mr. Walter, whose name
was synonymous with good tidings, should be associated
with her in the return of the child. Yes, she would wait.
And when Katy <em>was</em> secured, what then? Why, she
would leave forever a city fraught with such painful associations;
she would make her a new home. Home?
Her heart leaped!&mdash;comforts for Nettie and Katy,&mdash;clothes&mdash;food,&mdash;earned
by her own hands!&mdash;Tears trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
through Ruth&rsquo;s fingers, and her heart went out in a murmured
prayer to the &ldquo;God of the widow and fatherless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I play house with these?&rdquo; said Nettie, touching
Ruth&rsquo;s elbow, and pointing to the unopened letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, little puss,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;not yet. Wait a bit till
I have glanced at them;&rdquo; and she broke the seal of one.</p>

<p>It was an offer of marriage from a widower. He had
read an article of hers on &ldquo;Step-Mothers,&rdquo; and was &ldquo;very
sure that a woman with <em>such</em> views could not fail to
make a good mother for his children.&rdquo; He was thirty-five&mdash;good-looking,
(every man who had written her a
love-letter <em>was</em>!) good disposition&mdash;warm-hearted&mdash;would
love her just as well as if he had never bent an adoring
knee to Mrs. Dorrance No. 1&mdash;was not at all set in his
ways&mdash;in fact preferred she should, in everything, save
him the trouble of <em>choice</em>; would live in any part of the
Union she desired, provided she would only consent to
<em>the union</em>. These last two words Mr. Dorrance had italicised,
as indicating, probably, that he considered it a pun
fit even for the critical eye of an authoress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said Ruth, throwing the letter to Nettie,
&ldquo;make anything you like of it, pussy; it is of no value to
me.&rdquo; The next letter ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the honor to be guardian to a young Southern
lady (an orphan) of large fortune, who has just completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
her education. She has taken a suite of apartments, and
given me orders to furnish them without regard to expense,
according to her fancy. I have directions to procure
busts of Mrs. Hemans, Miss Landon, and several
other distinguished female writers, among whom Miss Le
Roy includes &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; (I have not the pleasure, madam, of
knowing your true name,) with whose writings she has become
familiar, and who is as great a favorite with her as she
is with the multitude who have paid tribute to her genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please send me a line, (my address as below,) allowing
me to inform my ward how her favorite wish can be
best carried out.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span>    <span class="sign1">Thomas Pearce.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ruth glanced around her little dark room and smiled.
&ldquo;I would rather, instead, that an artist would take a sketch
of my room, now,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;that little black stove, where
I have so often tried in vain to thaw my frozen fingers&mdash;that
rickety old bed&mdash;the old deal table, with its yellow
bowl of milk&mdash;that home-made carpet&mdash;those time-worn
chairs&mdash;and then you, my little bright fairy, in the foreground;&rdquo;
and she pushed back the soft, glossy curls
from Nettie&rsquo;s fair brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;better reserve the niche destined
for &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; for some writer to whom ambition is not the
hollow thing it is to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what have we here? Another letter?&rdquo; Ruth
broke the seal of letter No. 3, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a poor devil, and worse editor; nevertheless, I
have started a paper. If you will but allow me to put
your name on it as Assistant Editress, I am sure it will
go like a locomotive. If, in addition to this little favor,
you could also advance me the sum of one hundred dollars,
it would be an immense relief to your admirer,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;John K. Staples.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.&nbsp;S.&mdash;Be sure you direct to John <em>K.</em> Staples, as
there is another John Staples in this place, who is a great
rascal.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;S.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, &ldquo;I did not believe I should
ever be astonished again, but then&mdash;I had not heard from
Mr. Staples. But here is another letter. Let us see
what the contents of No. 4 are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letter No. 4 ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a better son, a better brother, a better husband,
and a better father, than I was before I commenced reading
your articles. May God bless you for the words you
have spoken (though unintentionally) so directly to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
May you be rewarded by Him to whom the secrets of
all hearts are known.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your grateful friend,</span>    <span class="sign1">M.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;D.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will repay many a weary hour,&rdquo; said Ruth, as
her tears fell upon the page.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> rain had poured down without mitigation for
seven consecutive days; the roads were in a very
plaster-y state; dissevered branches of trees lay scattered
upon the ground; tubs and hogsheads, which careful
housewives had placed under dripping spouts, were full
to overflowing; the soaked hides of the cattle looked
sleek as their owners&rsquo; pomatum&rsquo;d heads of a Sunday;
the old hen stood poised on one leg at the barn-door, till
even her patience had given out; the farmers had mended
all the old hoe and rake handles, read the Almanac
through and through, and worn all the newspapers and
village topics threadbare, when the welcome sun at last
broke through the clouds, and every little and big puddle
in the road hastened joyfully to reflect his beams.</p>

<p>Old Doctor Hall started down cellar for his &ldquo;eleven
o&rsquo;clock mug of cider;&rdquo; to his dismay he found his slippered
pedestals immersed in water, which had risen
above the last step of the cellar-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty piece of work this rain has made, Mis.
Hall,&rdquo; said the doctor, stamping his wet feet and blowing
his nose, as he returned from his visit to the lower regions;
&ldquo;the water has overflowed the cellar, and got
most up to those hams that you set such store by. You&rsquo;d
better tell Bridget to climb over the heads of those barrels,
and get the hams out before they are clean sp&rsquo;iled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the last words had fairly left the doctor&rsquo;s mouth
the old lady&rsquo;s cap-strings were seen flying towards the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do it, for anybody,&rdquo; exclaimed the new help,
as she placed her red arms a-kimbo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
risk my neck going over those tittlish barrels in that
dark cellar, for all the hams that was ever cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can carry a lamp with you,&rdquo; suggested the old
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do it, I tell you,&rdquo; said the vixen; &ldquo;help is
skerse out here in the country, and I can get a new place
before sundown, if I like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy!&rdquo; screamed the old lady, with a shrill voice,
&ldquo;Katy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy started from her corner and came out into the
entry, in obedience to the summons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Katy; Bridget is as contrary as a mule,
and won&rsquo;t go into the cellar to get those hams. I cannot
go in after &rsquo;em, nor the doctor either, so you must go in
and bring them out yourself. Climb up on those barrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
heads, and then feel your way along to the further corner;
go right down the cellar-stairs now, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I cannot! I <em>dare</em> not!&rdquo; said Katy, trembling and
shrinking back, as the old lady pushed her along toward
the cellar-door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> afraid,&rdquo; said the child, peeping down the cellar-stairs,
with distended eyes, &ldquo;oh, <em>don&rsquo;t</em> make me go
down in that dark place, grandma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dark, pooh!&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;what are you
afraid of? rats? There are not more than half-a-dozen
in the whole cellar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Bridget go?&rdquo; asked Katy; &ldquo;oh, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em>
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bridget <em>won&rsquo;t</em>, so there&rsquo;s an end of that, and I&rsquo;m not
going to lose a new girl I&rsquo;ve just got, for your obstinacy;
so go right down this minute, rats or no rats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t! if you kill me I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Katy, with
white lips, and clinging to the side of the cellar door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say you shall,&rdquo; said the old lady, unclinching
Katy&rsquo;s hands; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you belong to me, I&rsquo;d like to
know? and can&rsquo;t I do with you as I like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Ruth, receiving the fainting form of her
frightened child; &ldquo;no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor! doctor!&rdquo; said the old lady, trembling with
rage; &ldquo;are you master in this house or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;when <em>you</em> are out of it,&rdquo; growled the doctor;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s to pay now?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, matter enough. Here&rsquo;s Ruth,&rdquo; said the old
lady, not noticing the doctor&rsquo;s taunt; &ldquo;Ruth interfering
between me and Katy. If you will order her out of the
house, I will be obliged to you. I&rsquo;ve put up with
enough of this meddling, and it is the last time she shall
cross this threshold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never spoke a truer word,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;and
my child shall cross it for the last time with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and you no better than
a beggar! The law says if the mother can&rsquo;t support her
children, the grand-parents shall do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mother <em>can</em>&mdash;the mother <em>will</em>,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;I
have already earned enough for their support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you have, which I doubt, I hope <em>you earned
it honestly</em>,&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s heightened color was the only reply to this
taunt. Tying her handkerchief over Katy&rsquo;s bare head,
and wrapping the trembling child in a shawl she had provided,
she bore her to a carriage, where Mr. Walter and
his brother-in-law, (Mr. Grey,) with little Nettie, awaited
them; the door was quickly closed, and the carriage
whirled off. The two gentlemen alternately wiped their
eyes, and looked out the window as Katy, trembling, crying,
and laughing, clung first to her mother, and then to
little Nettie, casting anxious, frightened glances toward
the prison she had left, as the carriage receded.</p>

<p>Weeping seemed to be infectious. Ruth cried and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
laughed, and Mr. Grey and Mr. Walter seemed both to
have lost the power of speech. Little Nettie was the
first to break the spell by offering to lend Katy her
bonnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do better than that,&rdquo; said Ruth, smiling
through her tears; &ldquo;we will get one for Katy when we
stop. See here, Katy;&rdquo; and Ruth tossed a purse full
of money into Katy&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;You know, mother said she
would come for you as soon as she earned the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I <em>knew</em> you would, mother; but&mdash;it was so
very&mdash;&rdquo; and the child&rsquo;s lips began to quiver again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so excited, poor thing,&rdquo; said Ruth, drawing her
to her bosom; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk about it now, Katy; lean your
head on me and take a nice nap;&rdquo; and the weary child
nestled up to her mother, while Nettie put one finger on
her lip, with a sagacious look at Mr. Walter, as much as
to say, &ldquo;<em>I</em> will keep still if <em>you</em> will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not resemble you as much as Nettie does,&rdquo;
said Mr. Grey to Ruth, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is like her father,&rdquo; said Ruth; the &ldquo;resemblance
is quite startling when she is sleeping; the same breadth
of forehead, the same straight nose, and full lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has often been a great solace to me,&rdquo; said
Ruth, after a pause, &ldquo;to sit at Katy&rsquo;s bedside, and aid
memory by gazing at features which recalled so vividly
the loved and lost;&rdquo; and she kissed the little nestler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nettie,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;is Ruth 2d, in face, form
and feature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the resemblance ended there,&rdquo; whispered
Ruth, with a sigh. &ldquo;These rose-tinted dawns too often
foreshadow the storm-cloud.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">An</span> hour after the conversation narrated in the last
chapter, the driver stopped at a fine-looking hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the place, then, where you are going to stay
for a few weeks, before you leave this part of the country
for &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter; &ldquo;allow me to speak
for a dinner for us all; such a day as this does not dawn
on us often in this world;&rdquo; and he glanced affectionately
at little Katy.</p>

<p>The party was soon seated round a plentifully-furnished
table. Nettie stopped at every other mouthful to
look into Katy&rsquo;s eyes, or to kiss her, while little Katy
gazed about bewilderingly, and grasped her mother&rsquo;s
hand tightly whenever her ear caught the sound of a
strange voice or footstep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have some soup, little puss?&rdquo; said Mr.
Walter, after they were seated at the table, pulling one
of Nettie&rsquo;s long curls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask my mother,&rdquo; replied the child, with a quizzical
look; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the <em>soup</em>-erintendent.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Walter threw up his hands, and a general shout
followed this precocious sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, when he had done
laughing; &ldquo;you have begun too early, little puss; come
here and let me feel your head. I must take a phrenological
look at you. Bless me! what an affectionate little
creature you must be,&rdquo; said he, passing his hand over her
head; &ldquo;stick a pin there now, while I examine the rest of
your bumps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not stick a pin in my head,&rdquo; said Nettie;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that way of expressing an o-<em>pin</em>-ion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No further examination is necessary,&rdquo; said the extinguished
Mr. Walter; &ldquo;I have done with <em>you</em>, Miss
Nettie. What do you mean?&rdquo; whispered he to Ruth,
&ldquo;by having such a child as that? Are we going to have
another genius in the family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing; &ldquo;she
often says such things when she gets excited and hilarious,
but I never encourage it by notice, and you must
not; my physician told me not to teach her anything,
and by all means not to let her see the inside of a schoolroom
at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;Miss Nettie and I
must have a tilt at punning some day. You had better
engage, Ruth, to furnish the Knickerbocker with smart repartees
for his &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s Table,&rsquo; from your own fireside.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prenez garde</i>,&rdquo; whispered Ruth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t spoil her.
Such a child needs careful training; she is high-spirited,
warm-hearted, and sensitive;&rdquo; and Ruth sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I interpret your thoughts,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter; &ldquo;but
we must have no backward glances to-day. Those children
will never suffer what you have suffered; few women
ever did. Ruth, for the thousandth time I tell you, you
are a brave woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, suddenly,
blushing and thrusting his hand in his pocket, &ldquo;I have
committed the sin so common to all <em>man</em>-kind; carried
letters for you round in my pocket all this time, without
delivering them: here they are. I never saw a woman
have so many letters as you do, &lsquo;Floy;&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll need a
private secretary before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth broke the seal of one, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse
me a few moments,&rdquo; and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;We have established a very successful
Infant School in our neighborhood, numbering about fifty
pupils. Our first anniversary occurs next month. It is
our intention to gather together the parents and children,
and have a sort of jubilee; hymns will be sung, and short
pieces spoken. We should be very much obliged to you
if you would write us a little dialogue to be repeated by
two little girls, of the age of six; something sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
simple, such as you know how to write. We make no
apology for thus intruding on your time, because we
know your heart is with the children.</p>

<span class="f9">&ldquo;Secretary of the Leftbow Infant School.&rdquo;</span><br />

<p>&ldquo;Patience, gentlemen, while I read No. 2,&rdquo; said Ruth.
No. 2 ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Guardy has sent me up to this academy. I hate
academies. I hate Guardy&rsquo;s. I hate everything but
snipe shooting and boating. Just now I am in a horrid
fix. Every fellow in this academy has to write a composition
once a week, I cannot do it. I never could.
My talents don&rsquo;t lie in that way. I don&rsquo;t know where
they do lie. What I want of you is to write those compositions
for me. You can do it just as easy as water
runs down hill. You could scratch one off while I am
nibbing my pen. Old Phillips will think they are uncommon
smart for me; but never mind, I shall keep
dark, and you are such a good soul I know you can&rsquo;t refuse.
My cigars have been out two whole days; so you
may know that I have no funds, else I would send you a
present.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span>    <span class="sign1">Hal. Hunnewell.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>After glancing over this letter Ruth broke into a merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
laugh, and saying, &ldquo;This is too good to keep,&rdquo; read it
aloud for the amusement of the company, who unanimously
voted Hal. Hunnewell a composition every week,
for his precocious impudence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, as Ruth took up No.
3, &ldquo;if you have another of the same sort, let us hear it,
unless it be of a confidential nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth looked over the letter a moment, and then read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma has read me some of your stories. I like
them very much. You say you love little children.
Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve got a bran new baby! It came
last night when I was asleep in my trundle-bed. It is a
little pink baby. Mamma says it will grow white by-and-bye.
It has got such funny little fingers; they look
all wrinkled, just like our maid&rsquo;s when she has been at the
wash-tub. Mother has to stay in bed with him to keep
him warm, he&rsquo;s such a little cold, shaky thing. He hasn&rsquo;t
a bit of hair, and he scowls like everything, but I guess he&rsquo;ll
be pretty by-and-bye. Anyhow I love him. I asked
mother if I might not write and tell you about him, and
she laughed and said, I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is, nor
where she lives; but Uncle Jack (he gives me lots of
candy and dolls) said that I must send it to &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; publishers!
I don&rsquo;t know what a publisher is, and so I told
Uncle Jack; and he laughed and said he would lose <em>his</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
guess if I didn&rsquo;t have something to do with them one of
these days. I don&rsquo;t know what that meant either, and
when I asked him, he said &lsquo;go away, Puss.&rsquo; I think it
is very nice to have an Uncle Jack at Christmas and
New Year&rsquo;s, but other times they only plague little children.
I wish I could see you. How do you look? I
guess you look like mamma; mamma has got blue eyes,
and soft brown hair, and her mouth looks very pleasant
when she smiles. Mamma&rsquo;s voice is as sweet as a robin&rsquo;s,
so papa says. Papa is a great big man, so big that nobody
could ever hurt me, or mamma. Papa wants to
see you too. Won&rsquo;t you write me a letter, a little letter
all to myself? I&rsquo;ve got a box made of rosewood, with a
lock and key on it, where I&rsquo;d hide it from Uncle Jack,
(that would tease him!) Uncle Jack wants to see you
too, but I hope you never will let him, for he&rsquo;s such a
terrible tease, he&rsquo;d plague you dreadfully. I guess our
baby would send his love to you if he only knew you.
Please write me soon, and send it to Kitty Mills, care of
Uncle Jack Mills, and please seal it up all tight, so he
cannot peep into it.</p>

<p class="r2">&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I want you to write a book of stories for little
girls, and don&rsquo;t make them end bad, because it makes me
cry; nor put any ghosts in them, because it scares me;
or have any &lsquo;moral&rsquo; down at the bottom, because Uncle
Jack always asks me if I skipped it. Write something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
funny, won&rsquo;t you? I like funny things, and fairy stories.
Oh, I like fairy stories so <em>much</em>! Wasn&rsquo;t it nice about
the mice and the pumpkin, in Cinderella? Make them
all end well, won&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you do not feel any curiosity to know what
the papers say about your book,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, as
Ruth refolded her letters. &ldquo;I have quite a stock of notices
in my pocket, which I have saved up. You seem to
have taken the public heart by storm. You could not desire
better notices; and the best of it is, they are spontaneous&mdash;neither
begged nor in a measure demanded, by
a personal call upon the editors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at &lsquo;the spirit of &lsquo;76&rsquo; flashing from her eyes,&rdquo;
said Mr. Grey, laughing, as he pointed at Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean this,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;that not long since I
expressed my surprise to an able critic and reviewer, that
he could praise a certain book, which he must have known
was entirely deficient in merit of any kind. His answer
was: &lsquo;The authoress of that book made a call on me at
my office, deprecated in the strongest terms any adverse
criticism in the paper with which I am connected; said
that other papers would take their tone from mine, that it
was her first book, and that her pen was her only means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of support, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="nc" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> What can a man do under such circumstances?&rsquo;
said my informant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How <em>could</em> she?&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Of what ultimate advantage
could it be? It might have procured the sale of
a few copies at first, but a book, like water, will find its
level. But what astonishes me most of all is, that any
able reviewer should be willing to risk his reputation as
a critic by such promiscuous puffery. How are the people
to know when he speaks his <em>real</em> sentiments? It
strikes me,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing, &ldquo;that such a critic
should have some cabalistic mark by which the initiated
may understand when he speaks truthfully. It is such
a pity!&rdquo; continued Ruth thoughtfully; &ldquo;it so neutralizes
criticism. It is such a pity, too, that an authoress
could be found so devoid of self-respect as to do such a
thing. It is such an injury to those women who would
disdain so to fetter criticism; who would launch their
book like a gallant ship, prepared for adverse gales,
not sneaking near the shore, or lowering their flag for fear
of a stray shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Ruth,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;when I hear
you talk, I no longer wonder at Hyacinth&rsquo;s lack of independence
and common sense; his share must, by some
unaccountable mistake, have been given to you in addition
to your own. But where are the children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked around; Katy and Nettie, taking advantage
of this prolonged discussion, had slid from the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in company with a plate of nuts and raisins, and were
holding an animated conversation in a further corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! what a great, big mark on your arm, Katy,&rdquo;
exclaimed Nettie; &ldquo;how <em>did</em> it come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied Katy; &ldquo;grandma did it. She talked
very bad about mamma to grandpa, and I started to go
up into my little room, because, you know, I <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>
bear to hear it; and she called to me, and said, &lsquo;Katy,
what are you leaving the room for?&rsquo; and you know,
Nettie, mamma teaches us always to tell the truth, so
I said, &lsquo;because I cannot bear to stay and hear you say
what is not true about my mamma.&rsquo; And then grandma
threw down her knitting, seized me by the arm, and set
me down, oh, <em>so</em> hard, on a chair; and said, &lsquo;but you
<em>shall</em> hear it.&rsquo; Then, oh, Nettie, I <em>could not</em> hear it, so I
put my fingers in both ears; and then she beat me, and
left that place on my arm, and held both my hands while
she made me listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this recital, Nettie&rsquo;s eyes glowed like living
coals. When Katy concluded, she clenched her little
fists, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, why didn&rsquo;t you strike her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy shook her head, and said in a low tone, &ldquo;Oh,
Nettie, she would have killed me! When she got angry
she looked just like that picture of Satan we saw once in
the shop window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, I <em>must</em> do something to her,&rdquo; said Nettie, closing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
her teeth together, and planting her tiny foot firmly
upon the floor; &ldquo;she <em>shan&rsquo;t</em> talk so about mamma. Oh,
if I was only a big woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we must <em>forgive</em> her,&rdquo; said Katy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the impulsive little Nettie, &ldquo;never&mdash;never&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you cannot say your prayers,&rdquo; said the wise
little Katy; &ldquo;&lsquo;forgive us, as we forgive those who have
trespassed against us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; exclaimed the orthodox Nettie;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you wish that hadn&rsquo;t been put in? What <em>shall</em>
we do, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nettie,&rdquo; said her mother, who had approached unnoticed,
&ldquo;what did you mean when you said just now, that
you wished you were a big woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie hung her head for a minute, and twisted the
corner of her apron irresolutely; at last she replied with
a sudden effort, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t love me, mamma, but I will
tell you; I wanted to cut grandma&rsquo;s head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Katy laughed outright, as the idea of this Lilliputian
combatant presented itself. Ruth looked serious.
&ldquo;That is not right, Nettie,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;your grandmother
is an unhappy, miserable old woman. She has
punished herself worse than anybody else could punish
her. She is more miserable than ever now, because I
have earned money to support you and Katy. She <em>might</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
have made us all love her, and help to make her old age
cheerful; but now, unless she repents, she will live miserably,
and die forsaken, for nobody can love her with
such a temper. This is a dreadful old age, Nettie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;ll forgive her,&rdquo; said Nettie, jumping into
her mother&rsquo;s lap; &ldquo;but I hope I shan&rsquo;t ever hear her say
anything against you, mother. I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t Katy.
Didn&rsquo;t you ever wish, Katy, that she might fall down
stairs and break her neck, or catch a fever, or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, what a funny girl Nettie is!&rdquo; said Katy,
laughing till the tears came; &ldquo;I had almost forgotten her
queer ways! Oh, how grandmother <em>would</em> have boxed
your ears, Nettie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The incorrigible Nettie cut one of her pirouettes across
the room, and snapped her fingers by way of answer to
this assertion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ruth and her children were conversing, the two
gentlemen were quite as absorbed in another corner of
the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It astonishes me,&rdquo; said Mr. Grey to Mr. Walter,
&ldquo;that &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; should be so little elated by her wonderful
success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will cease to do so when you know her better,&rdquo;
said Mr. Walter; &ldquo;the map of life has been spread out
before her; she has stood singing on its breezy heights&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
has lain weeping in its gloomy valleys. Flowers
have strewn her pathway&mdash;and thorns have pierced her
tender feet. The clusters of the promised land have
moistened her laughing lip&mdash;the Dead Sea apple has
mocked her wasted fingers. Rainbows have spanned
her sky like a glory, and storms have beat pitilessly on
her defenceless head. Eyes have beamed upon her smiling
welcome. When wounded and smitten, she fainted
by the way, the priest and the Levite have passed
by on the other side. &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; knows every phase of
the human heart; she knows that she was none the
less worthy because poor and unrecognized; she knows
how much of the homage now paid her is due to
the <em>showy setting</em> of the gem; therefore, she takes all
these things at their true valuation. Then, my friend,&rdquo;
and Mr. Walter&rsquo;s voice became tremulous, &ldquo;amid all
these &lsquo;well done&rsquo; plaudits, <em>the loved voice is silent</em>. The
laurel crown indeed is won, but the feet at which she fain
would cast it have finished their toilsome earth-march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time we gentlemen were going; let us talk
business now,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, as Ruth returned from
her conversation with the children. &ldquo;How long did you
propose remaining here, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a month or so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have several
matters I wish to arrange before bidding adieu to this
part of the country, I shall try to get through as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
as possible, for I long to be settled in a permanent and
comfortable home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall return this way in a month or six weeks,&rdquo;
said Mr. Walter, &ldquo;and if you are ready at that time, I
shall be most happy to escort you and your children to
your new residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye,&rdquo;
shouted both the children, as the two gentlemen left the
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t</span> know about holding you <em>both</em> in my lap
at once,&rdquo; said Ruth smiling, as Nettie climbed up
after Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, please,&rdquo; said Nettie, &ldquo;and now let us have a nice
talk; tell us where we are going to live, mamma, and if
we can have a kitty or a rabbit, or some live thing to
play with, and if we are going to school, and if you are
going to leave off writing now, and play with Katy and
me, and go to walk with us, and ride with us. Shan&rsquo;t we
have some rides? What is the matter, mamma?&rdquo; said
the little chatterbox, noticing a tear in her mother&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, dear, how happy we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that funny?&rdquo; said Nettie to Katy, &ldquo;that mamma
should cry when she is happy? I never heard of
such a thing. <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t cry when I&rsquo;m happy. Didn&rsquo;t we
have a good dinner, Katy? Oh, I like this house. It was
such an old dark room we used to live in, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
nothing pretty to look at, and mamma kept on writing,
and I had nothing to play with, except a little mouse, who
used to peep out of his hole, when it came dark, for
some supper. I liked him, he was so cunning, but I
couldn&rsquo;t give him any supper, because&mdash;&rdquo; here the little
chatterbox glanced at her mother, and then placing her
mouth to Katy&rsquo;s ear, whispered, with a look the gravity of
which was irresistible, &ldquo;because mamma couldn&rsquo;t support
a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth laughed heartily as she overheard the remark,
and Nettie thought her mother more of a puzzle than ever
that she should keep laughing and crying so in the wrong
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you there, Nettie?&rdquo; asked Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something,&rdquo; said Nettie, looking very wise, as she
hid her chubby hands under her pinafore. &ldquo;It is a secret.
Mamma and I know,&rdquo; said she with a very important air,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t we, mamma? Would you tell Katy, mother, if
you were me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Ruth; &ldquo;you know it would not be
pleasant to keep such a great secret from Katy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie looked very searchingly into her mother&rsquo;s eyes,
but she saw nothing there but sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you <em>ever</em> tell, Katy, ever? it is a terrible
secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Katy, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even to Mr. Walter?&rdquo; asked Nettie, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
learned to consider Mr. Walter as their best friend, and
the impersonation of all that was manly and chivalrous.</p>

<p>Katy shook her head negatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Nettie, hanging her head with a
pretty shame, &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m in love!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, rocking
herself to and fro, and ejaculating, &ldquo;Oh! mamma!
oh! did you ever? Oh, how funny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny?&rdquo; said Nettie, with the greatest naîvete, &ldquo;it
wasn&rsquo;t funny at all; it was very nice. I&rsquo;ll tell you all
how it happened, Katy. You see I used to get so tired
when you were away, when I had nobody to play with,
and mamma kept up such a thinking. So mamma said I
might go to a little free school opposite, half-a-day, when
I felt like it, and perhaps that would amuse me. Mamma
told the teacher not to trouble herself about teaching
me much. Well, I sat on a little low bench, and right
opposite me, across the room, was such a <em>pretty</em> little
boy! his name was Neddy. He had on a blue jacket,
with twelve bright buttons on it; I counted them; and
little plaid pants and drab gaiters; and his cheeks were
so rosy, and his hair so curly, and his eyes so bright, oh,
Katy!&rdquo; and Nettie clasped her little hands together in a
paroxysm of admiration. &ldquo;Well, Katy, he kept smiling
at me, and in recess he used to give me half his apple,
and once, when nobody was looking,&mdash;<em>would</em> you tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
mamma?&rdquo; said Nettie, doubtfully, as she ran up to her
mother. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell, now, Katy, certainly?&rdquo; again
asked Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; promised Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even to Mr. Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once, when the teacher wasn&rsquo;t looking, Katy,
he took a piece of chalk and wrote &lsquo;Nettie&rsquo; on the palm
of his hand, and held it up to me and then kissed it;&rdquo;
and Nettie hid her glowing face on Katy&rsquo;s neck, whispering,
&ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t it beautiful, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Katy, trying to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nettie, &ldquo;I felt most ashamed to tell
mamma, I don&rsquo;t know why, though. I believe I was
afraid that she would call it &lsquo;silly,&rsquo; or something; and I
felt just as if I should cry if she did. But, Katy, she
did not think it silly a bit. She said it was beautiful to
be loved, and that it made everything on earth look
brighter; and that she was glad little Neddy loved me,
and that I might love him just as much as ever I liked&mdash;just
the same as if he were a little girl. Wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em>
nice?&rdquo; asked Nettie. &ldquo;I always mean to tell mamma
everything; don&rsquo;t you, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not told Katy, yet, what you have hidden
under your apron, there,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said Nettie, producing a little picture.
&ldquo;Well, Neddy whispered to me one day in recess, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
he had drawn a pretty picture on purpose for me, and
that he was going to have a lottery; I don&rsquo;t know what
a lottery is; but he cut a great many slips of paper, some
long and some short, and the one who got the longest
was to have the picture. Then he put a little tiny mark
on the end of the longest, so that I should know it; and
then I got the picture, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did he take all that trouble?&rdquo; asked the practical
Katy. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he give it to you right out, if
he wanted to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because,&rdquo; said Nettie, twirling her thumbs,
and blushing with a little feminine shame at her boy-lover&rsquo;s
want of independence, &ldquo;he said&mdash;he&mdash;was&mdash;afraid&mdash;the&mdash;boys&mdash;would&mdash;laugh
at him if they found it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken it, if I had been
you,&rdquo; said the phlegmatic Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you know, I <em>loved</em> him so,&rdquo; said Nettie naîvely.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Days</span> and weeks flew by. Katy and Nettie were never
weary of comparing notes, and relating experiences.
Nettie thought gloomy attics, scant fare and cross landladies,
the climax of misery; and Katy considered a
score of mile-stones, with Nettie and a loving mother at
one end, and herself and a cross grandmother at the
other, infinitely worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you can&rsquo;t tell anything about it,&rdquo; said Katy.
&ldquo;Grandma took away a little kitty because I loved it,
and burned up a story-book mamma brought me, and
tore up a letter which mamma printed in big capitals on
a piece of paper for me to read when I was lonesome;
and she wouldn&rsquo;t let me feed the little snow-birds when
they came shivering round the door; and she made me
eat turnips when they made me sick; and she said I must
not run when I went to school, for fear it would wear my
shoes out; and she put me to bed <em>so</em> early; and I used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
to lie and count the stars (I liked the seven little stars
all cuddled up together best); and sometimes I looked
at the moon and thought I saw faces and mountains in it,
and I wondered if it was shining into mamma&rsquo;s window;
and then I thought of you all snug in mamma&rsquo;s bed; and
then I cried and cried, and got up and looked out into the
road, and wondered if I could not run away in the night,
when grandmother was asleep. Oh, Nettie, she was a
<em>dreadful</em> grandmother! She tried to make me stop loving
mother. She told me that she loved you better than
she did me; and then I wanted to die. I thought of it
every night. I knew it was not true, but it kept troubling
me. And then she said that very likely mamma
would go off somewhere without letting me know anything
about it, and never see me again. And she always
said such things just as I was going to bed; and then you
know I could not get to sleep till almost morning, and
when I did, I dreamed such dreadful dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor little thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Nettie, with patronizing
sympathy, to her elder sister, and laying her
cheek against hers, &ldquo;you poor little thing! Well, mamma
and I had a horrid time, too. You can&rsquo;t imagine!
The wind blew into the cracks of the room <em>so</em> cold; and
the stove smoked; and I was afraid to eat when we <em>had</em>
any supper, for fear mamma would not have enough.
She always said &lsquo;I am not hungry, dear,&rsquo; but I think she
did it to make me eat more. And one night mamma had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
no money to buy candles, and she wrote by moonlight;
and I often heard her cry when she thought I was asleep;
and I was so afraid of mamma&rsquo;s landladies, they screamed
so loud, and scowled at me so; and the grocer&rsquo;s boy
made faces at me when I went in for a loaf of bread, and
said &lsquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t we a fine lady, aint we?&rsquo; And the wheel
was off my old tin cart&mdash;and&mdash;oh&mdash;dear&mdash;Katy&mdash;&rdquo; and
Nettie&rsquo;s little voice grew fainter and fainter, and the
little chatterbox and her listener both fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ruth, as she listened in the shadow of the further corner,
thanked God that they who had had so brief an acquaintance
with life&rsquo;s joys, so early an introduction to
life&rsquo;s cares, were again blithe, free, and joyous, as childhood
ever should be. How sweet to have it in her power
to hedge them in with comforts, to surround them with
pleasures, to make up to them for every tear of sorrow
they had shed,&mdash;to repay them for the mute glance of
sympathy&mdash;the silent caress&mdash;given, they scarce knew
why, (but, oh, how touching! how priceless!) when her
own heart was breaking.</p>

<p>And there they lay, in their pretty little bed, sleeping
cheek to cheek, with arms thrown around each other.
Nettie&mdash;courageous, impulsive, independent, irrepressible,
but loving, generous, sensitive, and noble-hearted.
Katy&mdash;with veins through which the life-blood flowed
more evenly, thoughtful, discriminating, diffident, reserved,
(so proud of those magnetic qualities in her little sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in which she was lacking, as to do injustice to her own
solid but less showy traits;) needing ever the kind word
of encouragement, and judicious praise, to stimulate into
life the dormant seeds of self-reliance. Ruth kissed them
both, and left their future with Him who doeth all things
well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock at night! Ruth lies dreaming by the
side of her children.</p>

<p>She dreams that she roves with them through lovely
gardens, odorous with sweets; she plucks for their
parched lips the luscious fruits; she garlands them with
flowers, and smiles in her sleep, as their beaming eyes
sparkle, and the rosy flush of happiness mantles their
cheeks. But look! there are three of them! Another
has joined the band&mdash;a little shadowy form, with lambent
eyes, and the smile of a seraph. Blessed little
trio. Follows another! He has the same shadowy outline&mdash;the
same sweet, holy, yet familiar eyes. Ruth&rsquo;s
face grows radiant. The broken links are gathered up;
the family circle is complete!</p>

<p>With the sudden revulsion of dream-land, the scene
changes. She dreams that the cry of &ldquo;fire! fire!&rdquo; resounds
through the streets; bells ring&mdash;dogs howl&mdash;watchmen
spring their rattles&mdash;boys shout&mdash;men whoop,
and halloo, as they drag the engine over the stony pavements.
&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo; through street after street, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
dreams the watch-word flies! Windows are thrown up,
and many a night-capped head is thrust hastily out, and
as hastily withdrawn, when satisfied of the distant danger.
Still, on rush the crowd; the heavens are one broad glare,
and still the wreathed smoke curls over the distant
houses. From the doors and windows of the doomed
building, the forked flame, fanned by the fury of the
wind, darts out its thousand fiery tongues. Women
with dishevelled locks, and snow-white vestments, rush
franticly out, bearing, in their tightened clasp, the sick,
maimed, and helpless; while the noble firemen, heedless
of risk and danger, plunge fearlessly into the heated air
of the burning building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now Ruth moves uneasily on her pillow; she becomes
conscious of a stifling, choking sensation; she slowly
opens her eyes. God in heaven! it is not all a dream!
With a wild shriek she springs from the bed, and
snatching from it her bewildered children, flies to the
stairway. It has fallen in! She rushes to the window,
her long hair floating out on the night-breeze.</p>

<p>A smothered groan from the crowd below. &ldquo;They
are lost!&rdquo; The showering cinders, and falling rafters,
have shut out the dreadful tableau! No&mdash;the smoke
clears away! That portion of the building still remains,
and Ruth and her children are clinging to it with the
energy of despair. Who shall save them? for it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
death to mount that tottering wall. Men hold their
breath, and women shriek in terror. See! a ladder is
raised; a gallant fireman scales it. Katy and Nettie are
dropped into the outstretched arms of the crowd below;
the strong, brave arm of Johnny Galt is thrown around
Ruth, and in an instant she lies fainting in the arms of a
by-stander.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The butchering, ambitious conqueror, impudently issues
his bulletins of killed and wounded, quenching the sunlight
in many a happy home. The world shouts bravo!
bravo! Telegraph wires and printing-presses are put in
requisition to do him honor. Men unharness the steeds
from his triumphal car, and draw him in triumph through
the flower-garlanded streets. Woman&mdash;gentle woman,
tosses the slaughtering hero wreaths and chaplets; but who
turned twice to look at brave Johnny Galt, as, with pallid
face, and smoky, discolored garments, he crawled to his
obscure home, and stretched his weary limbs on his miserable
couch? And yet the clinging grasp of rescued
helplessness was still warm about his neck, the thrilling
cry, &ldquo;save us!&rdquo; yet rang in the ears of the heedless
crowd. God bless our gallant, noble, but <em>unhonored</em> firemen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXV.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Strange</span> we do not hear from John,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Millet to her wooden husband, as he sat leisurely
sipping his last cup of tea, and chewing the cud of his reflections;
&ldquo;I want to hear how he gets on; whether he is
likely to get any practice, and if his office is located to suit
him. I hope Hyacinth will speak a good word for him;
it is very hard for a young man in a strange place to get
employment. I really pity John; it must be so disagreeable
to put up with the initiatory humiliations of a young
physician without fortune in a great city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he go round and ask people to give him work,
just like cousin Ruth?&rdquo; asked a sharp little Millet, who
was playing marbles in the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time you were in bed, Willy,&rdquo; said his disconcerted
mother, as she pointed to the door; &ldquo;go tell
Nancy to put you to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, Mr. Millet, it is very hard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
poor John&mdash;he is so sensitive. I hope he has a nice
boarding-house among refined people, and a pleasant
room with everything comfortable and convenient about
it; he is so fastidious, so easily disgusted with disagreeable
surroundings. I hope he will not get low-spirited.
If he gets practice I hope he will not have to <em>walk</em> to see his
patients; he ought to have a nice chaise, and a fine horse,
and some trusty little boy to sit in the chaise and hold the
reins, while he makes his calls. I hope he has curtains
to his sleeping-room windows, and a nice carpet on the
floor, and plenty of bed-clothes, and gas-light to read by,
and a soft lounge to throw himself on when he is weary.
Poor John&mdash;I wonder why we do not hear from him.
Suppose you write to-day, Mr. Millet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Millet wiped his mouth on his napkin, stroked his
chin, pushed back his cup two degrees, crossed his knife
and fork transversely over his plate, moved back his chair
two feet and a half, hemmed six consecutive times, and
was then safely delivered of the following remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;over-coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The overcoat was brought in from its peg in the entry;
the left pocket was disembowelled, and from it was ferreted
out a letter from &ldquo;John,&rdquo; (warranted to keep!)
which had lain there unopened three days. Mrs. Millet
made no remark;&mdash;that day had gone by;&mdash;she had ate,
drank, and slept, with that petrifaction too long to be
guilty of any such nonsense. She sat down with a resignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
worthy of Socrates, and perused the following
epistle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my sign hangs out my office-door, &lsquo;Doctor
John Millet,&rsquo; and here I sit day after day, waiting for
patients&mdash;I should spell it <em>patience</em>. This is a great city,
and there are plenty of accidents happening every hour in
the twenty-four, but unluckily for me there are more than
plenty of doctors to attend to them, as every other door
has one of their signs swinging out. Hyacinth has been
sick, and I ran up there the other day, thinking, as he is a
public man, it might be some professional advantage to
me to have my name mentioned in connection with his
sickness; he has a splendid place, six or eight servants,
and everything on a corresponding scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of Ruth&rsquo;s astonishing success! I was in hopes
it might help me a little in the way of business, to say
that she was my cousin; but she has cut me dead. How
could <em>I</em> tell she was going to be so famous, when I requested
her not to allow her children to call me &lsquo;cousin John&rsquo;
in the street? I tell you, mother, we all missed a figure
in turning the cold shoulder to her; and how much money
she has made! I might sit in my office a month, and
not earn so much as she can by her pen in one forenoon.
Yes&mdash;there&rsquo;s no denying it, we&rsquo;ve all made a great mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Brother Tom writes me from college, that at a
party the other night, he happened to mention (incidentally,
of course) that &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; was his cousin, when some
one near him remarked, &lsquo;I should think the less said
about that, by &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; relatives, the better.&rsquo; It frets
Hyacinth to a frenzy to have her poverty alluded to.
He told me that he had taken the most incredible pains to
conciliate editors whom he despised, merely to prevent
any allusion to it in their columns. I, myself, have sent
several anonymous paragraphs to the papers for insertion,
contradicting the current reports, and saying that
&lsquo;&ldquo;Floy&rdquo; lost her self-respect before she lost her friends.&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t suppose that was quite right, but I must have an
eye to my practice, you know, and it might injure me if
the truth were known. I find it very difficult, too, to get
any adverse paragraph in, she is getting to be such a favorite
(<abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr> anywhere where it will <em>tell</em>;) the little scurrilous
papers, you know, have no influence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very expensive living here; I am quite out of
pocket. If you can get anything from father, I wish
you would. Hyacinth says I must marry a rich wife as
he did, when I get cornered by duns. Perhaps I may,
but your rich girls are invariably homely, and I have an
eye for beauty. Still there&rsquo;s no knowing what gilded
pill I may be tempted to swallow if I don&rsquo;t get into practice
pretty soon. Hyacinth&rsquo;s wife makes too many allusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to &lsquo;her family&rsquo; to suit me (or Hyacinth either
if the truth must be told, but he hates a dun worse, so
that squares it, I suppose). Love to Leila.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVI.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Good</span> afternoon, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said one of the old
lady&rsquo;s neighbors; &ldquo;here is the book you lent me.
I am much obliged to you for it. I like it better than
any book I have read for a long while. You said truly
that if I once began it, I should not lay it down till I
had finished it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often read a book
now-a-days; my eyes are not very strong, (blue eyes seldom
are, I believe,&rdquo; said she, fearing lest her visitor
should suspect old Time had been blurring them;) &ldquo;but
that book, now, just suits me; there is common-sense in
it. Whoever wrote that book is a good writer, and
hope she will give us another just like it. &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is a
queer name; I don&rsquo;t recollect ever hearing it before. I
wonder who she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said the visitor; &ldquo;and what is more, I
mean to find out. Oh, here comes Squire Dana&rsquo;s son;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
he knows everything. I&rsquo;ll ask <em>him</em>. Yes, there he
comes into the gate; fine young man Mr. Dana. They
<em>do</em> say he&rsquo;s making up to Sarah Jilson, the lawyer&rsquo;s
daughter; good match, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said both the ladies in a breath;
&ldquo;glad to see you, Mr. Dana; folks well? That&rsquo;s right.
We have just been saying that you could tell us who
&lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; the author of that charming book, &lsquo;Life Sketches,&rsquo;
really is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are inclined to quiz me,&rdquo; said Mr. Dana. &ldquo;I
think it should be <em>you</em> who should give <em>me</em> that information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Us?&rdquo; exclaimed both the old ladies; &ldquo;us? we have
not the slightest idea who she is; we only admire her
book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I have an unexpected pleasure to bestow,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dana, rubbing his hands in great glee. &ldquo;Allow
me to inform you, Mrs. Hall, that &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is no more,
nor less, than your daughter-in-law,&mdash;Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Im</em>possible!&rdquo; screamed the old lady, growing very
red in the face, and clearing her throat most vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you it is true. My informant is quite reliable.
I am glad you admire your daughter-in-law&rsquo;s book,
Mrs. Hall; I quite share the feeling with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t admire it,&rdquo; said the old lady, growing
every moment more confused; &ldquo;there are several things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
in it, now I think of them, which I consider highly immoral.
I think I mentioned them to you, Mrs. Spear,&rdquo;
said she, (trusting to that lady&rsquo;s defective memory,) &ldquo;at
the time I lent it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Spear; &ldquo;you said
it was one of the best and most interesting books you
ever read, else I should not have borrowed it. I am
very particular what I put in my children&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have been thinking of what I was
saying,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;the book is very silly, a
great part of it, beside being very bold, for a woman, and
as I said before, really immoral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is highly recommended by the religious press,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dana, infinitely amused at the old lady&rsquo;s sudden
change of opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;I have no doubt
she wrote those notices herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has made an ample fortune, at any rate,&rdquo; said
the young man; &ldquo;more than I ever expect to make, if I
should scribble till dooms-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said the old lady, fidgeting in her
chair; &ldquo;or, if she has, it won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case she has only to write another book,&rdquo; said
the persistent Mr. Dana; &ldquo;her books will always find a
ready market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said the old lady bridling; &ldquo;it is my
opinion she&rsquo;ll go out like the wick of a candle. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
won&rsquo;t read a second edition of such trash. Ruth Hall
&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;? Humph! that accounts,&mdash;humph! Well, anyhow,
if she <em>has</em> made money, she had her nose held to
the grindstone pretty well first; that&rsquo;s one comfort.
<em>She</em> &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;? Humph! That accounts. Well, sometimes
money is given for a curse; I&rsquo;ve heern tell of such
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Yes, yes; I&rsquo;ve heern tell of such things,&rdquo; muttered
the old lady, patting her foot, as her two visitors left.
&ldquo;Dreadful grand, Ruth&mdash;&lsquo;Floy&rsquo; feels now, I suppose. A
sight of money she&rsquo;s made, has she? A great deal she
knows how to invest it. Invest it! What&rsquo;s the use of
talking about that? It will be invested on her back, in
silk gowns, laces, frumpery, and such things. I haven&rsquo;t a
silk gown in the world. The least she could do, would
be to send me one, for the care of that child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Yes, laces and feathers, feathers and laces. The
children, too, all tricked but like little monkeys, with
long ostrich legs, and short, bob-tailed skirts standing out
like opery girls, and whole yards of ribbin streaming
from their hair, I&rsquo;ll warrant. The Catechize clean driven
out of Katy&rsquo;s head. Shouldn&rsquo;t be at all astonished if
they went to dancing school, or any other immoral place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Wonder where they&rsquo;ll live? In some grand
hotel, of course; dinner at six o&rsquo;clock, black servants,
gold salt-cellars and finger-glasses; nothing short of
that&rsquo;ll suit now; humph. Shouldn&rsquo;t be astonished any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
day to hear Ruth kept a carriage and servants in livery,
or had been to Victory&rsquo;s Court in lappets and diamonds.
She&rsquo;s just impudent enough to do it. She isn&rsquo;t afraid
of anybody nor anything. Dare say she will marry some
Count or Duke; she has no more principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Humph! I suppose she is crowing well over me.
<strong title="Very well">V-e-r-y w-e-l-l</strong>; the wheel may turn round again, who
knows? In fact, I am sure of it. How glad I <em>should</em> be!
Well, I must say, I didn&rsquo;t think she had so much perseverance.
I expected she&rsquo;d just sit down, after awhile,
and fret herself to death, and be well out of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;! humph. I suppose I shan&rsquo;t take up a
newspaper now without getting a dose about her. I dare
say that spiteful young Dana will call here again just to
rile me up by praising her. What a fool I was to get
taken in so about that book. But how should I know it
was hers? I should as soon have thought of her turning
out Mrs. Bonaparte, as an authoress. Authoress!
Humph! Wonder how the heels of her stockings look?
S&rsquo;pose she wears silk ones now, and French shoes; she
was always as proud as Lucifer of her foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Well, I must say, (as long as there&rsquo;s nobody here
to hear me,) that she <em>beats all</em>. Humph! She&rsquo;ll collapse,
though; there&rsquo;s no doubt of <em>that</em>. I&rsquo;ve heard of
balloons that alighted in mud-puddles.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Good</span> morning, Mr. Ellet!&rdquo; said Mr. Jones, making
an attempt at a bow, which the stiffness of his shirt-collar
rendered entirely abortive; &ldquo;how d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how are you, Mr. Jones? I was just looking
over the Household Messenger here, reading my
daughter &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;s&rsquo; pieces, and thinking what a great
thing it is for a child to have a good father. &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;
was carefully brought up and instructed, and this, you
see, is the result. I have been reading several of her
pieces to a clergyman, who was in here just now, I keep
them on hand in my pocket-book, to exhibit as a proof
of what early parental education and guidance may do in
developing latent talent, and giving the mind a right direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not aware &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; <em>was</em> your daughter,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Jones; &ldquo;do you know what time she commenced
writing? what was the title of her first article and what
was her remuneration?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Ellet, wishing to gain a little time,
and looking very confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should not ask such questions,&rdquo; said the innocent
Mr. Jones, mistaking the cause of Mr. Ellet&rsquo;s hesitation;
&ldquo;but I felt a little curiosity to know something of
her early progress. What a strong desire you must have
felt for her ultimate success; and how much your influence
and sympathy must have assisted her. Do you know
whether her remuneration at the commencement of her
career as a writer, was above the ordinary average of
pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;really, Mr. Jones, I will not venture to
say, lest I should make a mistake; my memory is apt to
be so treacherous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wrote merely for amusement, I suppose; there
could be no <em>necessity</em> in <em>your</em> daughter&rsquo;s case,&rdquo; said the
blundering Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ellet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is astonishing how she can write so feelingly about
the poor,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones; &ldquo;it is so seldom that an
author succeeds in depicting truthfully those scenes for
which he draws solely upon the imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter, &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; has a very vivid imagination,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Ellet, nervously. &ldquo;Women generally have,
I believe; they are said to excel our sex in word-painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it may be so,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;&lsquo;Floy&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
certainly possesses it in an uncommon degree. It is difficult
else to imagine, as I said before, how a person, who
has always been surrounded with comfort and luxury,
could describe so feelingly the other side of the picture.
It is remarkable. Do you know how much she has realized
by her writings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, again,&rdquo; said the disturbed Mr. Ellet, &ldquo;my
memory is at fault; I am not good at statistics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some thousands, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jones.
&ldquo;Well, how true it is, that &lsquo;to him who hath shall be
given!&rsquo; Now, here is your literary daughter, who has no
need of money, realizes a fortune by her books, while
many a destitute and talented writer starves on a crust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ellet, &ldquo;the ways of Providence are
inscrutable.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Female</span> literature seems to be all the rage now,&rdquo;
remarked a gentleman, who was turning over the
volumes in Mr. Develin&rsquo;s book store, No. 6 Literary
Row. &ldquo;Who are your most successful lady authors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Pyne,&rdquo; said Mr. Develin, &ldquo;authoress of &lsquo;Shadows,&rsquo;
Miss Taft, authoress of &lsquo;Sunbeams,&rsquo; and Miss Bitman,
authoress of &lsquo;Fairyland.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been told,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;that &lsquo;Life
Sketches,&rsquo; by &lsquo;Floy,&rsquo; has had an immense sale&mdash;a larger
one, in fact, than any of the others; is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has had a <em>tolerable</em> sale,&rdquo; answered Mr. Develin,
coldly. &ldquo;I might have published it, I suppose, had I applied;
but I had a very indifferent opinion of the literary
talent of the authoress. The little popularity it <em>has</em> had,
is undoubtedly owing to the writer being a sister of Hyacinth
Ellet, the Editor of &lsquo;The Irving Magazine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>is</em> she his sister,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
many rumors afloat; one hardly knows what to believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Develin; &ldquo;in fact, I, myself,
<em>know</em> it to be true. &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is his sister; and it is altogether
owing to the transferring of her articles, by him,
to the columns of his paper, and his liberal endorsement
of them, that she has had any success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;why I was a subscriber
both for &lsquo;The Standard,&rsquo; when her first article appeared
in it, and also for &lsquo;The Irving Magazine,&rsquo; and I am
very sure that nothing of hers was copied in the latter until
she had acquired an enviable popularity all over the Union.
No, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, (for it was he,) &ldquo;I know a
great deal more about &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; and her writings than <em>you</em>
can tell me, and some little about yourself. I have often
heard of the version you give of this matter, and I came
in to satisfy myself if it had been correctly reported to
me. Now, allow me to set you right, sir,&rdquo; said he, with a
stern look. &ldquo;The Editor of &lsquo;The Irving Magazine&rsquo; never
recognized &lsquo;Floy&rsquo; as his sister, till the universal popular
voice had pronounced its verdict in her favor. Then,
when the steam was up, and the locomotive whizzing past,
he jumps on, and says, &lsquo;how fast <em>we</em> go!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Develin,
with a faint attempt to retain his position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not mistaken, sir; I know, personally, that in
the commencement of her literary career, when one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
articles of hers were copied into his paper by an assistant
in the office, he positively forbade her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i>
being again mentioned, or another of her articles copied
into the Irving Magazine. He is a miserable time-server,
sir. Fashion is his God; he recognizes only the drawing-room
side of human nature. Sorrow in satin he can
sympathize with, but sorrow in rags is too plebeian for
his exquisite organization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Develin; good morning, sir.
The next time I hear of your giving a version of this
matter, I trust it will be a correct one,&rdquo; added he with a
stern look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Walter, as he walked down
street, &ldquo;of all mean meanness of which a man can be
guilty, the meanest, in my estimation, is to rob a woman
of her justly-earned literary fame, and I wish, for the
credit of human nature, it were confined to persons of as
limited mental endowments and influence as the one I
have just left.&rdquo;</p>

Johnny Galt saved you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see that Johnny Galt is rewarded,&rdquo; replied
Ruth. &ldquo;But this is the day Mr. Walter was to have

<p>Katy and Ruth had not finished laughing at this sally,
when Mr. Walter was announced.</p>

<p>His greeting was grave, for he trembled to think of the
danger they had escaped. After mutual congratulations
had been exchanged, a detailed account of their escape
given, and Johnny Galt&rsquo;s heroism duly extolled, Mr.
Walter said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad to find you so comfortably housed
after the fire; but the sooner I take all of you under my
charge, the better, I think. What do you say to starting
for &mdash;&mdash; to-morrow? Are you sufficiently recovered
from your fright and fatigue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Ruth, laughing; &ldquo;do we not look as
good as new? Our wardrobe, to be sure, is in rather a
slender condition; but that is much easier remedied than
a slender purse, as I have good reason to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter; &ldquo;it is understood
that we go to-morrow. I have some business to look
after in the morning; shall you object to waiting till after
dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Ruth. &ldquo;In my opinion nothing
can equal the forlornness of forsaking a warm bed, to
start breakfastless on a journey, with one&rsquo;s eyes half
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Floy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, taking a package from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
pocket, &ldquo;I have obeyed your directions, and here is
something which you may well be proud of;&rdquo; and he
handed Ruth a paper. It ran thus:</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, laughing, &ldquo;imagine yourself,
if you can, in that dismal attic one year ago, a bank-stock
holder! Now confess that you are proud of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are proud of her,&rdquo; said the talkative Nettie; &ldquo;if
she is not proud of herself. Don&rsquo;t you think it is too bad,
Mr. Walter, that mamma won&rsquo;t let Katy and me tell that
&lsquo;Floy&rsquo; is our mother? A little girl who lived at the
hotel that was burnt up, said to Katy, that her uncle had
just given her Life Sketches for a birth-day present, and
told her that she must try and write as well as &lsquo;Floy&rsquo;
one of these days; and Katy looked at me, and I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
at Katy; and oh, isn&rsquo;t it <em>too bad</em>, Mr. Walter, that mamma
won&rsquo;t let us tell, when we want to so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter, laughing, &ldquo;I have only one
little remark to make about that, namely, I have no
doubt you two young ladies discovered some time before
I did, that when your mamma says <em>No</em>, there is an end to
all argument.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XC.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> morning of the next day was bright and fair. After
dinner our travelling party entered the carriage
in waiting, and proceeded on their way; the children chattering
as usual, like little magpies, and Ruth and Mr.
Walter occupied with their own solitary reflections.</p>

<p>One of the greatest luxuries of <em>true</em> friendship is the
perfect freedom one feels, irrespective of the presence of
another, to indulge in the mood of the moment&mdash;whether
that mood be grave or gay, taciturn or loquacious, the unspeakable
deliciousness of being reprieved from talking at
a mark, hampered by no fear of incivility or discourtesy.
Ruth had found this a great charm in the society of Mr.
Walter, who seemed perfectly to understand and sympathize
with her varied moods. On the present occasion
she particularly felt its value&mdash;oppressed as she was by
the rush of thoughts, retrospective and anticipatory&mdash;standing
as it were on the threshold of a new epoch in
her changing existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, mother?&rdquo; asked Katy, as the
carriage passed through a stone-gateway, and down a dim
avenue of ancient trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To dear papa&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;before we
leave this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; murmured Katy, in a low whisper.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>It was very beautiful, that old avenue of pine trees,
through which the setting sun was struggling faintly, now
resting like a halo on some moss-grown grave-stone, now
gilding some more ambitious monument of Mammon&rsquo;s
raising. The winding cemetery paths, thronged by day
with careless feet, were silent now. No lightsome
laughter echoed through those leafy dells, grating upon
the ear which almost listened for the loved voice. No
strange eye, with curious gaze, followed the thoughtful
group, speculating upon their heart&rsquo;s hidden history; but,
now and then, a little loitering bird, tempted beyond its
mate to lengthen its evening flight, flitted, with a brief
gush of song, across their pathway. Hushed, holy, and
unprofaned, was this Sabbath of the dead! Aching
hearts here throbbed with pain no longer; weary feet
were still; busy hands lay idly crossed over tired
breasts; babes, who had poised one tiny foot on life&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
turbid ocean brink, then shrank back affrighted at its
surging waves, here slept their peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moon had silvered the old chapel turrets, and the
little nodding flowers glistened with dew-drops, but still
Ruth lingered. Old memories were thronging, thick and
fast, upon her;&mdash;past joys&mdash;past sorrows&mdash;past sufferings;&mdash;and
yet the heart, which felt them all so keenly,
would soon lie pulseless amid these mouldering thousands.
There was a vacant place left by the side of
Harry. Ruth&rsquo;s eye rested on it&mdash;then on her children&mdash;then
on Mr. Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So help me God,&rdquo; reverently murmured the latter,
interpreting the mute appeal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled from under the old stone gateway,
a little bird, startled from out its leafy nest, trilled
forth a song as sweet and clear as the lark&rsquo;s at heaven&rsquo;s
own blessed gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accept the omen, dear Ruth,&rdquo; said Mr. Walter.
&ldquo;Life has much of harmony yet in store for you.&rdquo;</p>
